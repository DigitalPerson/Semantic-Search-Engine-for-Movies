<i>- What do we want?</i>

2
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,452

3
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,787

4
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,288

5
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,873
What do we want?
Justice!

6
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,458
When do we want it?
Now!

7
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,751

00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,462

Justice!

10

When do we want it?
Now!

11
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,385
<i>Your Honor, it's murder.</i>

12
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,261
Even when the police do it.

13
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,765
Detective William James Taggart
swore an oath

14
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:05,644
to protect and serve
the people of New York.

15
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,145
He shattered that oath.

16
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,107
The State will prove
there is probable cause

17
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:13,652
to try him for the murder
of Mikey Tavarez.

18
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,612
Thank you, Your Honor.

19
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,822
Mr. Davies.

20
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,532
Your Honor, it isn't murder

21
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,158
when the other guy
shooting at you.

22
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,496
It isn't murder
when the other guy has a gun.

23
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,557
What are we drinking, chief?

24
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,600
Nothing for me, sir.

25
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,894
Civilization gone to pieces.

26
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,945
You know, there are
a lot of men in this town

27
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,197
who would find it hard
to trust a man

28
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,116
as respectable as you.

29
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,826
I am not one of those men.

30
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,412
Your boss,
the police commissioner,

31
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,705
he's an asshole.

32
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,416
I came to discuss
the Taggart case, sir.

33
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,376
What is there to discuss?

34
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,961
It won't make it
past preliminary.

35
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,838
Maybe we should hope it does,
sir.

36
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,758
Those people outside
will find it very hard

37
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,551
to believe it wasn't murder,
plain and simple.

38
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,344
How's this for
plain and simple?

39
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,264
There's one less homicidal
rapist walking the streets.

40
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,267
Mikey Tavarez was found innocent
of those charges.

41
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,727
He walked on a technicality.

42
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,563
We know he raped
and killed Yesenia Barea.

43
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,648
The law says differently, sir.

44
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,444
You always this much fun, chief?

45
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,696
I think Billy Taggart is a hero.

46
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,741
And I like getting my photo
taken next to heroes.

47
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,409
I also like winning
Staten Island

48
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,869
without having to go there.

49
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:49,414
A witness came forward
this morning.

50
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,917
We are two minutes away
from the judge's decision.

51
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,211
He came forward with evidence.

52
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,421
Where is it?

53
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,757
It's been temporarily misplaced.

54
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,675
The witness?

55
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,177
A kid.

56
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,350
Is he legal?

57
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,602
Is his mother legal?

58
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,437
Find out what he wants.

59
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,773
It appears he wants justice,
sir.

60
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,234
Well, nobody gets that.

61
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,945
What do you want, chief?

62
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,241
I want what's best for the city,
sir.

63
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,453
<i>It is the court's view</i>

64
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,415
that the State has failed
to present a clear case...

65
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,211
...for why the shooting
should amount to murder

66
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,046
and not self-defense.

67
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,591
Therefore, the defendant
will not be held

68
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,802
to answer to these charges
at trial.

69
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,304
He's free to go.
Court adjourned.

70
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:53,645
Detective.

71
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,938
Sorry to interrupt.

72
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,857
Chief Fairbanks
wants to see you.

73
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,820
Here's our guy.

74
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,072
How are you?
Mr. Mayor.

75
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,325
Hey, chief.
Sit down, detective.

76
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,995
What's this about?
- Sit down.

77
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,454
Don't worry about the chief.

78
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,332
We drew straws for
"good cop, bad cop" and he won.

79
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,459
What does he want,
to interrogate me?

80
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,213
No, I just wanted to get
in a room with you.

81
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,258
I wanted to tell you
how proud I am of you.

82
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,260
You've done the city
a great favor.

83
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,013
You, in my eyes, hero.

84
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,472
Thank you.

85
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,765
Here's the thing.

86
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,226
Some uncomfortable evidence
has come to light.

87
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,688
If it should come out,
we will be fucked.

88
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,358
It is a necessity
that we remain unfucked.

89
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,695
So...
You're done, detective.

90
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,990
Yesenia Barea was 16 years old,
chief.

91
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,366
Mikey Tavarez was exonerated.

92
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,494
And they got it wrong.
So you put it right.

93
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,704
I'm not the bad guy.

94
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,497
Keep telling yourself that.

95
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,249
Billy, there's
some wars you fight

96
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,376
and some wars
you walk away from.

97
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,421
Mayor--
This is not the fighting kind.

98
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,882
I have a long memory, son.

99
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,885
If you ever change
your number,

100
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,013
you make sure
you let my office know.

101
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,591
<i>Mayor Nicholas Hostetler</i>

102
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,426
<i>is Wall Street's</i>
<i>approved candidate.</i>

103
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,220
<i>That's the charge</i>
<i>from the mayor's rival,</i>

104
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,805
<i>Councilman Jack Valliant,</i>

105
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,599
<i>who spoke to reporters</i>
<i>earlier today.</i>

106
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,835
What the fuck are you doing?
Hey, what--

107
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,758
What the fuck's
going on out here?

108
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,092
Take it easy.

109
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,511
What's going on?
This guy attacked me.

110
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,348
Motherfucker!

111
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,478
No, stop!

112
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,605
No, please, no.

113
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,732
Fucker.

114
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,983
Where's my camera?

115
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,361
Sweetheart, look at me
for a second, please?

116
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,614
Thank you.

117
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,492
Son of a bitch.

118
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,040
Just like in the beginning.

119
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,168
No one would admit
something was happening.

120
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:48,088
Never happened.
Never happened.

121
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,509
Big part. Disturbing.

122
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,976
Ow. All right, all right.

123
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,063
When are you going to stop this?
Stop what?

124
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,273
Coming home looking like
bloody meat.

125
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,360
I thought you liked bloody meat.
I'm a vegetarian.

126
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,987
You got to get
your protein somehow.

127
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,489
You're an asshole.

128
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,698
Ow.

129
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,493
Did you pick up your dress
for the premiere?

130
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,786
Tomorrow.

131
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,080
Am I gonna like
this dress?

132
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,331
I think you'll approve.

133
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,083
Will Ryan like this dress?

134
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,168
I don't know.
I'm not familiar with his taste.

135
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,586
I see the looks he gives you.

136
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,089
How come you see these looks
and I don't?

137
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,758
You see the best in people,
it's your fatal flaw.

138
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,552
What's yours?

139
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,429
Not being able to see
the best in people.

140
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,098
Not even me?

141
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,934
You're the exception,
you know that.

142
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:46,020
I'm an actress.
Maybe I've got you fooled.

143
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,692
I'm a detective.
You couldn't if you tried.

144
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,576
<i>It's down to the wire,</i>

145
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,452
<i>with New Yorkers set to vote</i>

No, Tom, not a few weeks.
Months.

Payment.

Yeah, I'll wait.

It's called collections.

about never being broke

164
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,887
if somebody owes you?

165
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,096
We're broke.

166
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,934
Yeah, I'm still holding.

167
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,602
Yeah.

168
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,813
What is this?

169
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,983
Some guy from Staten Island
said he's gonna kill you.

170
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:16,778
Call him back.
Tell him he owes me a camera.

171
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:20,531
Oh. Oh,
he just stepped out?

172
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,992
Yeah, just now?

173
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,578
Well, you tell him he's got

174
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,497
till the close of business
today

175
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,833
to call Katy
from Billy Taggart's office.

176
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,753
Or else I'm gonna tell his wife
he's been screwing his assistant

177
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,130
for the past 11 months.

178
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,758
Are you serious?

179
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,053
These people provoke me, Billy.
All day. You don't know.

180
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,972
This is a professional
workplace, Katy.

181
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,765
Yeah. Once more
with conviction.

182
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:51,104
How much have you cleared?
Uh, like $1800.

183
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,897
Not bad.
How much is outstanding?

184
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,358
Forty-two thousand.

185
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,111
Give me the fucking numbers.
Yeah.

186
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,656
How about I garnish your wages
and put a lien on your garage

187
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:04,409
until I've gotten every cent
of the 8 grand you owe?

188
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,160
<i>How about I pay</i>
<i>in installments?</i>

189
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,578
Three installments of 2650,

190
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,539
I want the first payment
this Friday.

191
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,165
<i>Jimmy. Hey, buddy.</i>

192
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,376
It's Billy.
<i>- What's up, Bill?</i>

193
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,713
Oh, just hoping I can get
that payment, buddy.

194
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,465
<i>Well, things have been</i>
<i>a little slow here.</i>

195
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,968
<i>I've been, uh, having</i>
<i>some rough times.</i>

196
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:25,179
<i>How many times</i>
<i>did you catch him,</i>

197
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,597
<i>literally,</i>
<i>with his pants down</i>

198
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,017
<i>and I pay for his infidelity?</i>

199
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,227
You're the one that hired me,
Amber.

200
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,564
<i>I'm supposed to foot</i>
<i>the goddamn bill?</i>

201
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,941
<i>How many times, Billy?</i>
<i>Tell me.</i>

202
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,361
Eight times, Amber,
for a total of $4000. Come on.

203
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,238
<i>Send him the invoice then!</i>

204
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,242
<i>Listen, Billy,</i>
<i>I'm not paying you a dime.</i>

205
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,328
I want my fucking money.

206
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,663
<i>You'll get it. Nev-uary.</i>

207
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,415
What kind of man are you, Dave?

208
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,834
A man who doesn't pay
his debts

209
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,044
is the worst kind of all.

210
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,795
Is that the kind of man you are?

211
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,424
Okay, okay. I can maybe get you
<i>half by Monday.</i>

212
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,303
Half is fair. I can do half.
Talk to Katy.

213
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,430
Hey, Dave, Katy.

214
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:10,641
So, what time on Monday, huh?

215
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,852
I'm going to get some air.
Okay.

216
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,111
Billy! Billy!

217
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,739
Phone!
Take a message!

218
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,324
It's the mayor.

219
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,251
You seem nervous.

220
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,171
It's probably the bomb
I got shoved up my asshole.

221
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,966
Too soon?

222
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,552
Councilman Valliant, any comment
on the Bolton Village sale?

223
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,930
I think this is a sad day
for New York.

224
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,683
I never thought I'd see a mayor
of this city, even this mayor,

225
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,477
stoop so low
as to steal the homes

226
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,729
of 30,000 hardworking
New Yorkers.

227
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,314
And I will not let
this sale stand

228
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,108
when I'm elected mayor
on Tuesday.

229
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,568
<i>Is the timing</i>
<i>of the announcement political?</i>

230
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,487
<i>Absolutely, it's political.</i>

231
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,572
<i>That's not to say</i>
<i>Nick Hostetler doesn't care.</i>

232
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,575
Evidently, he cares very deeply
<i>about two things:</i>

233
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,662
<i>His own job and taking care</i>
<i>of his buddies on Wall Street.</i>

234
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,540
<i>What's your message to</i>
<i>the people of Bolton Village?</i>

235
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,208
<i>Help is on the way.</i>

236
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,836
<i>Come Tuesday you will have</i>
<i>an ally in City Hall.</i>

237
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,296
Listen to this guy, Mike.

238
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,340
Can't even get his numbers
right.

239
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,468
Bolton Village is home
to 37,512.

240
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,345
And you know what this deal
means for them?

241
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,640
Valliant seems to think
it means eviction, mayor.

242
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,184
Valliant thinks.

243
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,811
What it means
is better service.

244
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,688
It means more attentive
landlords,

245
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,023
somebody showing up
when the toilet is blocked

246
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,650
or the heat's on the fritz.

247
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,986
It means paint on the walls
and it means windows fixed.

248
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:48,197
Valliant says Solstein Donagan's
going to jack up their rents,

249
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,699
replace them with yuppies.

250
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,702
This is a great deal

251
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,495
for the people
of Bolton Village

252
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,331
and it's a great deal
for the city of New York.

253
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,791
Do you think the announcement
of this deal

254
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,544
ill add to your poll numbers?

255
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,713
Well, you know, Mike,

256
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,007
if the readers
<i>of the New York Post</i>

257
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,342
want to reward
competence,

258
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,970
who am I to argue with that?
Excuse me.

259
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,639
Yeah?

260
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,602
Well, obviously
that was some attempt at humor.

261
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:21,063
No, call off the brigade.
Bring him up. Thank you.

262
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:24,358
All right, Mike,
get out of here.

263
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,735
Go do the people's work.

264
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,904
Good luck Tuesday.
Thank you.

265
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:31,657
Look. Here's one for the car.
One for the wife.

266
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,576
And one for the kid,
put it on his school bag.

267
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,245
Thanks.
All right.

268
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,081
Mr. Mayor.
Hey.

269
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,583
You know, Billy,

270
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,629
we take threats of terrorism
very seriously around here.

271
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:45,671
I--

272
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,090
Even from good Catholic boys
like you.

273
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,513
I'm kidding. Look at you.
Looking all civilized.

274
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,389
It's good to see you, mayor.

275
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,475
You see this golden boy
on your way in?

276
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,519
I caught a glimpse.

277
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,396
You know,
if I'm being honest,

278
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,524
I find it
faintly insulting.

279
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,735
What, that you're running
dead even with a nobody?

280
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,822
Yeah.

281
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,283
You always were more balls
than tact.

282
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,953
I'm actually trying
to reverse the trend.

283
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,330
No, you shouldn't.
It's one of your strong suits.

284
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,626
Scotch?
Uh, I'm on the wagon, thank you.

285
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,961
Really?

286
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:28,422
What about if I just
pour one for you

287
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,300
and leave it between us
like a symbol?

288
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,636
You going to be able
to put this guy away?

289
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,306
I ever tell you
about Johnny Ingrisano?

290
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,016
I don't think
you told me that.

291
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,351
Every day, growing up in Queens,

292
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,688
this guy would pummel me
at recess.

293
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,357
What could I do?
I was just a kid.

294
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,734
A couple of years ago,

295
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,736
I heard Ingrisano
got in legal trouble.

296
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,073
The kind of trouble another guy
could get himself out of easily.

297
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,491
So I got involved.

298
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,036
Now, he scratches his
ass without permission,

299
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,830
he spends a week in Rikers.

300
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:05,501
Jack Valliant reminds me
of Johnny Ingrisano.

301
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,795
You ever do any hunting?

302
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,755
No.
You should try it.

303
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,467
You would be a natural.
And you'd love the dogs.

304
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,012
Women call men dogs.

305
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,598
They mean it to suggest
we're somehow

306
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,516
untrustworthy or disloyal.

307
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,435
But a dog is anything but.

308
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,771
And if men are dogs,

309
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,649
what the goddamn hell
does that make women?

310
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,901
You ever seen
a bitch in heat?

311
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,778
She'll grind herself
across the grass

312
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,655
to try and
get at that itch.

313
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,117
And if she can sneak out
of the backyard,

314
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,661
any dog will do.

315
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,456
I'm not sure
I'm following you, mayor.

316
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,377
I need you to help me find
the son of a bitch

317
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,004
who's fucking my wife.

318
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,382
You think she's having
an affair?

319
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,343
I know she's having an affair.

320
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,054
<i>Maybe you should call the Post</i>
<i>and confirm.</i>

321
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,431
She's smarter than that.

322
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,683
So is he.

323
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,393
He's like a goddamn phantom.

324
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,687
Maybe he doesn't exist.

325
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:10,816
I still want the pictures.
I want to know who he is.

326
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,818
I want to know
where he's from.

327
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,820
I want to know how big
his dick is, how long he lasts,

328
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,947
where do they fuck.
In hotels or his place?

329
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,574
I want to know
if he makes her come,

330
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,868
or if she fakes it
with him too.

331
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,454
And I want to know everything
by election day.

332
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:26,415
What's it got to do
with the election?

333
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,794
New Yorkers, they've elected
drunks, crooks,

334
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,254
Italians, homos, Jews
and blacks to that seat.

335
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,965
But they will not elect
is some guy whose wife

336
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,302
is fucking some other guy
behind his back.

337
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,680
Now this pussy,
this Jack Valliant,

338
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,599
he may be too much
of a lightweight

339
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,394
to use this story
if it comes across his desk.

340
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,105
But his staff
will not hesitate.

341
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,774
What if she doesn't see him
before Tuesday?

342
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,111
Then it's gonna be the easiest
$50,000 you ever made.

343
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,322
Half now, half later.

344
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,865
Half right now?

345
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,952
Right this instant.
What do you say?

346
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,495
I say yes.

347
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,289
You get me what I need.

348
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,959
I will, mayor.
Consider it done.

349
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,090
You can get my wife's schedule
from Valerie on the way out, hm?

350
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,969
Something wrong?

351
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,470
When you called,
I didn't think it would be

352
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,139
for something like this.

353
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,598
Yeah.

354
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,727
Neither did I.

355
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,983
Hey, Billy.

356
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,818
Welcome back.

357
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,571
Thanks, mayor.

358
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,635
Have you got time for breakfast?
Baby, have you seen my keys?

359
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:05,264
On the table,
by your hot sauce collection.

360
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,311
It looks like we
can do L.A. in style.

361
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,646
I landed a big contract,
I got some cushion now.

362
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,356
That sounds great.

363
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,943
I'll text you the details
for the cast dinner tomorrow.

364
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,196
No, I'm not going to that.

365
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,573
Those guys take that
metrosexual shit way too far.

366
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,158
I don't give a fuck
if you want to be

367
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,785
a thespian or a lesbian.

368
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,828
But when a man whips out
a compact

369
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,039
and a powder puff at dinner,
that's no good.

370
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,916
Can you pretend
to be interested?

371
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,584
Just one night, please.

372
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,836
It's not every day
your girlfriend stars

373
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,713
in her first indie film.

374
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,548
If you ask me nicely.

375
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,050
Can you please?

376
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,968
Yes.

377
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,598
Put some powder on me,
so I don't feel left out.

378
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:48,974
No.
Okay.

379
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,227
But I feel uncomfortable
around those people.

380
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,673
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the First Lady of New York,</i>

381
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:21,924
<i>Cathleen Hostetler.</i>

382
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,931
We did it!

383
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:34,311
Equality has finally come
to New York.

384
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,482
<i>Some said that now</i>
<i>wasn't the right time</i>

385
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,442

386
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,444
<i>Well, I say there's never</i>

387
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,364
<i>to fight</i>
<i>for what is rightfully yours.</i>

388
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,370
I say there is never

389
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,038
to stand up to the bullies.

390
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,292
<i>Even if they're powerful</i>
<i>bullies.</i>

391

<i>Especially if</i>
<i>they're powerful bullies.</i>

392
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,049
<i>That just makes the victory</i>

393
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,306

394
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,392
<i>Today we declare,</i>
<i>with our hearts full</i>

395
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,019

398
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,276
Thank you.

399
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,517
Come on, buddy,
show me your face.

400
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,687
Shit.

401
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,789
Damn.

402
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,593
<i>You read The Times this morning?</i>

403
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,553
No, I did not.

404
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,848
<i>I read the Post,</i>
<i>like the rest of New York.</i>

405
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,893
Interesting editorial.

406
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,271
That rag is a glorified tabloid
for rich people.

407
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,774
You're rich,
aren't you, Nick?

408
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,026
Filthy rich,

409
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,487
if recent events
are any indication.

410
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,075
I heard your speech went down
gangbusters last night.

411
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,118
Hmm.

412
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,995
Like opening night
<i>of Mamma Mia!</i>

413
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,580
Queens doing backflips
in the aisles.

414
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,374
Someone you know attend?

415
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:05,462
You know who's really excited
about this new law?

416
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,716
Who?
Artie.

417
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:12,261
He says he's never written
so many prenups in his life.

418
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,055
You remember Artie?

419
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,099
I think of him every day.

420
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,649
You didn't mention
the election last night.

421
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,985
It was not the proper forum.

422
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,321
Darling,

423
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,950
it's election season.

424
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,411
Every forum's the proper forum.

425
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,290
Act accordingly.

426
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,003
Bo!

427
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,131
Come here.

428
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,549
<i>Smile.</i>

429
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,511
A little to the left.

430
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,102
Is this what you do all day?

431
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,022
Spy on beautiful women
in swanky restaurants?

432
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:08,734
If you consider the finer
bodegas of Bensonhurst swanky.

433
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:12,488
We should do this more often.
It's time you earned your keep.

434
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,031
Does that mean I get paid
this month?

435
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,325
Yep. Soon as I see
that phone bill.

436
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,494
He's my brother.
What do you want?

437
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:19,995
Send him a phone card.

438
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:23,332
Yeah, I should, right?

439
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:26,919
He doing all right?

440
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:29,630
You know.

441
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,591
Sing Sing ain't no place
for guys with good hearts.

442
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,014
Why'd the mayor call you?

443
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,432
She's grabbing her things.

444
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,352
Shit. What do I do?
Calm down. Look at me.

445
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,145
Smile. Attagirl.

446
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,856
Stand up. Get your coat.
Keep smiling and talking.

447
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,526
My heart is pounding.
Purse.

448
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,903
Come here.

449
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,321
Beat her to the door.

450
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,740
Then get across the street
so you can cover her.

451
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,617
Call me when you got her.
Okay.

452
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,702
Katy, what do we have?

453
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,414
Uptown on Madison, towards 45th.
She picked up a bodyguard.

454
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,292
<i>Keep at her pace.</i>

455
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,920
Okay, she just
took a call.

456
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,964
BlackBerry?
It's a flip phone.

457
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,549
<i>I need you to get in closer.</i>

458
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,552
<i>Get me a name, Katy.</i>
<i>A place, a time, something.</i>

459
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,178
Okay.

460
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:22,057
No, no, no. I understand.
So, uh, what time, darling?

461
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,851
I'll be there.

462
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,811
It's him.
She's arranging a meeting.

463
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,563
<i>I got her.</i>

464
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,983
Yeah. I'll be there soon.

465
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,906
Go.

466
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,867
Ma'am! Ma'am!
Wait. Sorry.

467
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,911
It's yours.
I think you dropped this.

468
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,497
Yes, thank you.
Oh, you're welcome.

469
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,419
Should we follow her?

470
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,462
No, she'll figure
we were here soon enough.

471
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,214
Find out
who this number belongs to.

472
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,216
If he drives a Lexus,
we got our guy.

473
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,803
Welcome back to the Roosevelt,
Mrs. Hostetler.

474
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,597
Thank you, Kenny.

475
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,934
I got him.
You got him?

476
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,061
Oh, I got him.
And it's good, Billy.

477
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:12,191
How good?
Ah. Wondrous good.

478
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,067
They teach you that at DeVry?

479
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,695
I go to Hunter, asshole.
Oh, pardon me.

480
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,865
It's a sophisticated place.
I got sophisticated friends.

481
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:21,950
We read books, drink wine.

482
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,410
You old enough to drink?

483
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,245
You'd be surprised
what I'm old enough to do.

484
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,455
Hey, easy.

485
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:30,334
For example,
I'm old enough to vote.

486
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,378
It might come of some interest
when casting my ballot

487
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:37,174
to know that Jack Valliant's
campaign manager,

488
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:41,053
a guy named Paul Andrews,
is fucking the mayor's wife.

489
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:45,098
Bullshit.
And he drives a Lexus.

490
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,479
This is good.

491
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,356
It's borderline orgasmic,
Billy.

492
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,858
You learn that at Hunter too?

493
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,735
Wouldn't you like to know?

494
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,112
This is not gonna go over good
with the mayor.

495
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,157
That is a cold bitch.

496
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:06,245
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

497
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,873
<i>All luggage and parcels</i>
<i>must be attended at all times.</i>

498
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:13,126
Montauk. Round trip. Peak.

499
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,714
Thank you.

500
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,344
Whoa!

501
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,471
How you looking against the kid?

502
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,182
The numbers are holding steady.

503
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,892
Steady?
Yeah.

504
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:14,521
What the fuck does that mean?
Steady is a prelude to a shift.

505
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,690
In what direction?

506
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:20,610
The incumbent, Sam.
Always to the incumbent.

507
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,529
Really?

508
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,668
A little slow, Nick.

509
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,338
Yeah? You watch your ass,
I'll take care of mine.

510
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,048
I'm beginning to wonder
if you can.

511
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,342
It's like Griffith and Paret
in '62.

512
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,344
Emile Griffith and Benny Paret?

513
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,637
Yeah.
So the kid is Paret,

514
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,889
I'm Griffith.

515
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,265
So you're the fag?

516
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,061
I am Griffith
minus the fag angle.

517
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,437
I'm holding back.

518
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,482
I'm making him think
he's got it won.

519
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,068
Then comes the 12th round.
Remember that?

520
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,236
Yeah.

521
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,949
The kill shot.
Fuck you.

522
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,369
So, Nick,

523
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:15,457
I've got a half a million
sunk in your campaign

524
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,918
and a lot more riding
on the result.

525
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,587
So why don't you just tell me

526
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:23,131
how you're going to win
this thing?

527
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:34,393
We have dirt dropping
on the news desks

528
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,020
of every paper
and every network

529
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,689
across the city tonight.

530
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,108
Will it stick?

531
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,610
No, it won't stick.
It's all bullshit.

532
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,278
But it will smudge.

533
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,780
That will get
the undecideds thinking,

534
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:51,034
and Sunday night at the debate,
I will put him away.

535
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,703
Well, you better, Nick.

536
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,038
You just better.

537
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,759
You know
who you're voting for?

538
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,971
I don't think
I'll make it to the polls.

539
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,098
I try to vote for president,
but--

540
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,476
President doesn't determine
the quality of life in Brooklyn?

541
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,646
How'd you know
I was from Brooklyn?

542
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,690
You just told me
you were from Brooklyn.

543
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:24,985
I'm in the business
of picking up on these things.

544
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,653
What are you, a private eye?

545
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:31,533
No. Private eye?
Private eyes still exist?

546
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,994
What do you do, then?

547
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,454
I'm in politics.

548
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,165
So who do you recommend?
I recommend the new guy.

549
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,292
Ah, come on, he's too clean.

550
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,960
New York's this big,
messy place.

551
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,170
Does it have to be?

552
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,629
It could be better,

553
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,757
but it's been pretty good
under Hostetler.

554
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,886
What do you do, then?

555
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,513
I work sanitation.

556
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,101
You clean up pretty well
for a garbage man.

557
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,895
I'm doing it to impress a lady.

558
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,688
Ah, it's always a lady.

559
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,650
Local 831?

560
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,695
Yeah, 15 years.
Fifteen years.

561
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,532
You own a home?

562
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,451
In New York?
Exactly.

563
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,703
So why is it that you,
a union man,

564
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,705
and I take it
a native New Yorker--

565
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,374
Why is it that you don't own
your own home in the city?

566
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,876
But yet every Bernie and Gordon

567
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:26,671
who get off this train
with an MBA and no scruples,

568
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,797
they own one?

569
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,716
They own one in the city
and on the island.

570
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,219
So where is yours?

571
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,804
I'm just saying.

572
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,101
So you own a house out here?

573
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,021
No. No.
No, don't get me wrong.

574
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,649
I like the water and sand
and grass, but no.

575
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,734
Only thing better
than getting out of that city

576
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,944
is going back.

577
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,948
Just about everything and anyone
I love is in that city.

578

<i>The next and final stop</i>

Come on, William, tell us.
What do you do?

599
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,186
I don't do anything important.

600
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,355
I take pictures.
It's very boring.

Oh, shit.
You're not paparazzi, are you?

602

No, I actually, uh, mostly stick
to real people, so...

603
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,032
Billy is a private investigator.
He used to be a cop.

604
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,534
Get out of here.
- That's how you two met?

605
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,161
You promised
not to write her a ticket

606
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,496
if she goes out with you.

607
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,414
Yeah, something like that.

608
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,707
Details, details.

609
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,209
Come on, Billy.

610
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,878
How'd a guy like you
end up with a girl like Natalie?

611
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,213
A guy like me?

612
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,674
I can't imagine you're
big on theater.

613
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:19,260
Look, this is your guys' party.
Let's talk about your movie.

614
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,553
No one leaves this table

615
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,722
without singing the blues,
Billy.

616
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,015
Natalie, pick up the slack.

617
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,642
How'd you meet
this charming guy?

618
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,936
Billy was a friend
of the family.

619
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,105
You lived
in the same neighborhood?

620
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,023
He worked by where I lived.

621
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,234
You fell in love with the
neighborhood policeman?

622
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,403
Come on.

623
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,862
We were a bunch
of broke Puerto Ricans

624
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,740
nobody gave a damn about.
Billy was good to us.

625
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,034
Barrow.
Is that Puerto Rican?

626
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,328
It's actually Barea.

627
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,122
Natalie Barea.

628
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,707
Natalia.

629
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,750
That has a nice ring to it.

630
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,294
You changed it
so you could play more Anglo?

631
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,755
No.

632
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,259
I changed it because I was tired
of going to auditions

633
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,928
and the first question out
of the casting director's mouth

634
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:06,307
was if I was related
to Yesenia Barea.

635
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,809
Who's that?

636
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:08,852
My sister.

637
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,437
Is she famous or something?

638
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:13,231
Yeah. Her face was in all
the papers seven years ago.

639
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,524
Nat, please--

640
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:15,859
Beautiful 16-year-old girl,

641
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,277
raped and beaten to death

642
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,529
in an apartment
in Bolton Village.

643
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,620
Billy was good to us.

644
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:32,917
It was a really hard time
and he made it better.

645
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,887
Sure, that's because you like
to accuse anyone

646
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,639
who doesn't let the rich off,
of engaging in class warfare

647
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,141
when in reality,

648
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,185
you know full well
what real class warfare is.

649
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,520
That's stealing homes
of working people

650
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,314
and handing them over
at a cut rate

651
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,523
to an investment bank.

652
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,650
That, sir,
is real class warfare.

653
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,611
Maybe where you grew up
in Connecticut,

654
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,654
$3 billion
is considered cut-rate.

655
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,198
But here in New York City,

656
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,949
$3 billion is a lot of money

657
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,659
that can solve
a lot of problems.

658
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,453
You don't solve problems

659
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,788
by bending over
for billionaires.

660
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,915
I may bend over
for billionaires,

661
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,167
but you come from
a long line of them.

662
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,504
How are the renovations coming
on that $4 million townhouse

663
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,755
in Brooklyn Heights?

664
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,008
You want my house too?
Take it.

665
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,177
I'm upside-down on my mortgage
like the rest of this city.

666
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,180
Because the system has been
rigged by men like you.

667
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,893
Fuck, that's good.

668
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,645
Yeah?
You make that stick,

669
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,271
you pull undecideds
off the fence.

670
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,524
Okay.

671
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,359
We need that moment, Paul.

672
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,071
That "You are no Jack Kennedy"
moment.

673
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,697
It has to be
Bolton Village related.

674
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,825
Stick to the issues,

675
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,827
people will see the difference
between you two.

676
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,079
It's not clean enough, Paul.
It's gotta be clean cut.

677
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,164
He's got this clear line
of attack on me.

678
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,625
I'm the rich Connecticut
carpetbagger.

679
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,043
What the hell is he?

680
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,086
He's out of a job,

681
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,921
if you stick
to the fucking issues.

682
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,215
You're missing the point.
He's a crook!

683
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,842
I need to hammer that home

684
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,845
when he taunts me
about my family money

685
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,179
and Harvard and the rest.

686
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,098
I need to be able
to lay his fat ass flat.

687
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,725
"You, sir, are a crook.
And a liar."

688
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,103
And if tries to challenge me
to prove it,

689
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,230
I pull out
that glorious piece of paper

690
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,691
you said you'd provide me with
and read it out loud.

691
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:22,110
Let's take 10.
Can I talk to you?

692
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,738
All right,
so what's your problem, Jack?

693
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,074
<i>The Daily News is my problem,</i>
Paul.

694
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,243
<i>The Post, The Times,</i>
<i>they're all the same.</i>

695
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,996
Hostetler's backing up
a dump truck of shit on me

696
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:36,124
and our campaign has piss-all
in the way of pushback.

697
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,334
I thought
that's what Montauk was for.

698
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,836
What about your source?

699
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:42,589
I'm working on it.
That's what took nine hours?

700
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,883
He kept us waiting,
I told you.

701
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,134
You came back
stinking of booze.

702
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,344
I had a fucking cocktail,
sweetheart.

703
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,637
So where's our pushback?

704
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,764
Our pushback are truth
and facts.

705
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,516
That's how we play.

706
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,768
Where are our headlines?

707
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,687
We don't need headlines, Jack.

708
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,272
Because we're winning.

709
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:02,108
Even their internal polling
has us up by three.

710
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,444
You're winning
on your own terms.

711
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,904
But let me
tell you something.

712
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:09,782
You go on that debate stage
and try to win that debate

713
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,785
by going negative blow
to negative blow,

714
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,246
he will fucking destroy you.

715
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,331
Understand that.

716
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,917
Glad you got so much faith
in me, Paul.

717
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:22,378
I'm all faith,
you smug son of a bitch.

718
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,796
You try having some.

719
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,674
Just do me a favor.
Do your job.

720
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,803
Get me that file.

721
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:33,973
Yes, sir.

722
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,654
Hey, Murdock.

723
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,948
Save some for the rest of us.

724
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:53,451
Billy Taggart, holy shit.
What are you doing here?

725
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,495
I was in
the neighborhood.

726
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,871
Me too.

727
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,331
You club a herd of penguins
for that getup?

728
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:01,417
What can I say?
Private sector's good to me.

729
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,170
You a shamus?
No, security.

730
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,338
See that kid?

731
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,799
That's Todd Lancaster,
my charge.

732
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,093
Rich kid.
Pop tears down buildings.

733
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:11,844
And wants him to run
the business one day.

734
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,138
I'm making sure he stays
on the straight and narrow.

735
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,517
How you doing, Mr. Mayor?
Tony, how are you?

736
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,311
Harris, come and say hello.

737
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,232
This is Harris Sargent,
SVP at Solstein Donagan.

738
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,234
Helped me push through
the Bolton Village deal.

739
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,653
Four billion dollars we beat
out of this poor bastard.

740
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:33,533
Good to see you.
You remember my son, Todd.

741
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:34,993
If you do, you get a prize.

742
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,869
Todd, when will you
do the world a favor

743
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,705
and take the business
from your old man?

744
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,873
When I die
and he grows a pair.

745
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,501
Oh, shit.

746
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,044
Some fucking party, huh?

747
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,546
I'd rather be home
watching the Knicks.

748
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,214
Do what, lose?

749
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:52,051
This is the best game in town.
There's the commissioner.

750
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,469
It's the worst-kept secret

751
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,179
him and the mayor
can't stand each other.

752
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,557
But the commish
don't miss a party.

753
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,892
It's like watching
Italian opera.

754
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,978
What do you know about opera?

755
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:03,771
Just because I don't understand
the language

756
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,440
don't mean they ain't out
to fuck each other.

757
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,236
Suite 5101, Mr. Taggart.
I'm told it's urgent.

758
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,739
Excuse me.

759
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,491
In the neighborhood, my ass.

760
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,805
May I offer you a drink,
Mr. Taggart?

761
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,891
I don't drink.

762
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:43,269
But you used to.
I can tell.

763
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,312
How?

764
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,522
By those three seconds
you let pass

765
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,900
before turning down the drink.

766
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,818
How long has it been?

767
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,236
Seven years.

768
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,655
Good for you.

769
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,783
Finally hit rock bottom,
huh?

770
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:58,826
I did it to keep a woman.

771
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,703
Then you do believe in love.

772
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,789
I believe in loving
the one you're with.

773
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,000
What are you,
stupid or Catholic?

774
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,461
Both.

775
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:11,422
To your health, Mr. Taggart.

776
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:20,556
Perhaps you could explain
what I'm doing up here.

777
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:24,018
Being tailed is exhausting.

778
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,270
If I might pry,

779
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,981
how much are you being paid
for your efforts?

780
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,650
Which efforts
are those?

781
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,152
The work you're doing
for the mayor.

782
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:37,406
I'll give you $50,000
to give it up.

783
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,699
That's very generous,

784
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,326
but I got a contract
with the mayor.

785
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:41,452
Break it.

786
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,704
You don't break contract
with the mayor.

787
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,289
Don't I know it.

788
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,666
Why don't you just leave him?

789
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:49,252
This is not what you think
it is, Mr. Taggart.

790
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:52,171
I take pictures.
I don't get paid to think.

791
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,049
If the last seven years
of your life mean anything,

792
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,845
if that woman you put down
the bottle for means anything,

793
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,721
walk away.

794
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:04,267
Because if you think
you're investigating adultery

795
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:07,270
you don't know
Nicholas Hostetler very well.

796
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,367
I see you've met Billy.

797
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,911
Yes, we met.

798
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,663
Did he tell you
he's working for me?

799
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,039
He mentioned it.

800
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,043
Did he mention it was exclusive?
Yes, he did.

801
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:33,546
You used to know
what "exclusive" meant.

802
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:37,425
In this case,
it means I worked for it.

803
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:39,886
Keep your grubby little paws
off it.

804
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:42,847
Poor Nicky.

805
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,765
You never did learn
how to share,

806
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,559
did you?

807
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,019
Don't worry,

808
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:51,439
I'll teach you
before it's too late.

809
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,399
Careful, dear.

810
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,401
You too, darling.

811
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,197
Mr. Taggart, please take care.

812
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,536
I need a drink.

813
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,294
What have you got for me?

814
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:16,047
Actually, I think
I need a few more days.

815
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,506
I got things nailed down,

816
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:20,635
but I need another 48 hours
to confirm.

817
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:27,225
You have an envelope
of photographs in your pocket.

818
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:32,063
That I paid for.
Right? Right?

819
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,106
Burning a hole
in your bleeding heart?

820
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,210
Good work.

821
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,970
All right, Billy, we're done.

822
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,069
Hey, Ryan, you excited tonight?

823
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,283
Whoa! Wow!

824
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,819
I love the line between the sky
<i>and the water.</i>

825
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:04,780
You see how it gets darker
<i>the farther it is away,</i>

826
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,659
<i>just a line separating sky</i>
<i>from water.</i>

827
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,121
He's religious. I get it.

828
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,331
He's got to have hope,

829
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,333
have something to believe in.

830
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,168
<i>Why do you have</i>
<i>to bring him up?</i>

831
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:18,669
<i>What does it matter?</i>

832
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,172
<i>Not everything in this life</i>
<i>is black and white.</i>

833
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:24,342
<i>Let's not talk about him</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

834
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,136

853
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:49,427
You want a water back for that?
Just pour the fucking drink.

854
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,722
Billy, what are you doing?

855
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,349
Hey, Nat, I just...

856
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,768
I just didn't want to be
the only one not celebrating.

857
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,020
Billy, don't do this.
It's a party, right?

858
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,897
And what a fucking movie
that was.

859
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:05,693
I mean, my God,
I never seen you that good.

860
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:08,362
That was incredible.
You were so convincing.

861
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,156
Excuse me.
Can you take this drink back?

862
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:13,451
Please, I'm fine.
Billy, don't.

863
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,828
That's enough.
What?

864
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:17,329
What?

865
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,790
You promised me.
How can you hurt me like this?

866
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,125
How can I hurt you?

867
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,543
You haven't once asked me
how I feel.

868
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,628
This is not your night, Billy.

869
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:28,257
I've worked so hard for this.
It doesn't mean anything to you.

870
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,176
Why don't you go do a line too?

871
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:33,429
Go back to being the old Billy.
We know what a great guy he was.

872
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,014
I'm going to hang out
with my friends.

873
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,183
You mean Ryan?

874
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:39,143
You fuck him?

875
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,437
Don't do this.
Fine, I'll ask him.

876
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,272
Billy, just go home.
Please.

877
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,274
Tell me
or I'll start breaking shit.

878
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,193
There's nothing left for you
to break.

879
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:48,611
Tell me the truth.

880
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:50,279
You told me
it was gonna be artistic,

881
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,323
some simple love scene.

882
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,492
I can't do this anymore.
What does that mean?

883
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,369
It means we're in pieces.
We've always been in pieces.

884
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,830
I'm taking you home. Now.
Are you listening to me?

885
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:01,749
No, and you're not leaving me

886
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,792
for this bunch
of fucking assholes!

887
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,677
I can't.
Nat, please.

888
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,679
Natalie.

889
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,099
I'm sorry.

890
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,852
There's nothing left
between us, Billy.

891
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,103
Don't say that.
Nothing.

892
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,438
We've had a dead girl

893
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,774
holding us together
for seven years.

894
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,818
It's just
not enough anymore.

895
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,362
How could you say that?

896
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,113
Natalie, I'm sorry.

897
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,658
Nat, you all right?
Yeah.

898
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:39,370
Billy, stop it!
No! Let him go.

899
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,039
Billy, please.
Fucking actor.

900
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,707
Yeah, you fucked him.

901
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,727
What the fuck are you doing?
Wait a second.

902
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,576
You want to waste
my fucking money!

903
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:21,245
You want to waste
my fucking time.

904
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,273
Natalie?

905
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:52,526
Katy, I can't talk right now.

906
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,113
What?

907
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,949
Katy, don't fuck with me.
What are you saying?

908
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,953
Shit!

909
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,666
<i>All available units,</i>

910
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,668
<i>reports of multiple gunshots</i>
<i>in the vicinity</i>

911
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,629
<i>of Jane and Washington.</i>

912
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:15,633
<i>One victim reported.</i>
<i>Medical assistance is en route.</i>

913
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,718
Stand back,
right behind the line.

914
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,136
Stay back.

915
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:21,138
Hey, Tony.

916
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,848
He's with me.
Okay.

917
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,685
Thanks for doing this,
Jansen.

918
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,104
We get the first call
just after 1.

919
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,522
Reported gunshots.

920
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,484
Six more calls inside a minute,
all 211's.

921
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,445
First units arrive
around three minutes later.

922
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:37,988
He's already good
and dead by then.

923
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:41,325
What's it look like?
So far, so good on robbery.

924
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,493
He didn't have a wallet
on him

925
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,702
but his apartment's
right here,

926
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,329
so maybe he left it inside.

927
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,997
We're working
to get the landlord down here

928
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,207
to let us in.

929
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,458
Any cash
when you found him?

930
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,668
No keys, no cash.

931
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,920
Like I said,
so far, so good on robbery.

932
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,507
So when's the last time
you seen one of these?

933
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,183
You're not really
thinking robbery?

934
00:53:06,225 --> 00:53:09,269
No, we're spinning robbery.
Media's pushing robbery.

935
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,271
It's a counterfactual robbery.

936
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,815
Now it's your turn, Taggart.

937
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,858
What the hell
this got to do with you?

938
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,735
That's funny, Billy.

939
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,029
I was just about to ask you
that my damn self.

940
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,618
Okay, stay with me, Billy.
This is what I got.

941
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:28,330
I got a former N.Y.P.D.
detective-turned private eye

942
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,832
at a fund-raiser for the mayor.

943
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,126
If his mother's life
depended on it,

944
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,086
he couldn't find the money
to afford a ticket.

945
00:53:34,086 --> 00:53:36,630
That's Thursday.
Then, this is the good part.

946
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,509
Twenty-four hours later,
at the murder scene of the man

947
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:43,637
running the campaign
to unseat the mayor, poof.

948
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,390
Imagine,
that very same private eye.

949
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:48,267
Explain that to me, Billy.

950
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,602
Is this Hostetler?

951
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,187
Is this what you
gave him last night?

952
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,564
You gave him Andrews?

953
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,400
I gave him pictures.
You gave him pictures?

954
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,777
Who were the pictures of?
His wife.

955
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,904
His wife and who?
I can't tell you that.

956
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,909
You better start
telling me something.

957
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,662
Explain to me what are you doing
at my crime scene.

958
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,289
I was in the neighborhood.

959
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,957
You were just
in the neighborhood?

960
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,960
Paul Andrews is dead.

961
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,713
You think you're just gonna
piss on him and walk away?

962
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,214
This is an execution.

963
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,593
This is a fucking assassination.
Did you finger Andrews?

964
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,095
This what you do now, Billy,
set up executions?

965
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,305
Fuck you.
Fuck me?

966
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:28,348
Fuck you.
I took a job, chief.

967
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:29,767
I didn't ask questions.

968
00:54:29,767 --> 00:54:32,770
I gave him pictures
and I walked away.

969
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,521
Well, you think I gave him up
to get murdered?

970
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:37,775
I think you're too damn smart
to think you would set him up--

971
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,610
Fuck you. I did my job.

972
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:42,112
You fucking knew.
I did my job.

973
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,490
Commissioner.
Get out of here.

974
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,575
Let me tell you something,
Billy.

975
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:49,453
I'm taking Hostetler down.

976
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:50,996
He sees election day,

977
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,373
it'll be from inside a cage,
like a monkey.

978
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,292
Now, you either help me,

979
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:58,754
or you'll be in there with him
sucking on bananas too.

980
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,051
What?

981
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:06,595
Commissioner,
there's an issue.

982
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,515
Something up, commissioner?

983
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,183
You're on the door.
Nobody gets in here.

984
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,811
With all due respect--
You're on the fucking door.

985
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,158
Jack.

986
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,787
What happened tonight, Jack?

987
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,794
Don't worry about him,
he's with me.

988
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,716
Everyone's with you.

989
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,011
I need you to look at me, Jack.

990
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,681
Talk to me, okay?

991
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:53,892
Put the whiskey down, Jack.
Okay?

992
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,479
Okay, Jack?

993
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,026
Okay.

994
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,987
You need to straighten up,
Jack.

995
00:56:04,987 --> 00:56:06,196
Lock the door.

996
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,871
It's gonna be okay, Jack.

997
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,717
Just tell me exactly
what happened.

998
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:33,223
You know,
you're not a real cop.

999
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,058
You're just a whore.

1000
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,247
We're gonna go for a walk
and get some fresh air.

1001
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,540
You'll feel better, okay?

1002
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,250
Don't worry about that,
all right?

1003
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,877
I wanna help you, Jack.

1004
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:03,587
But I have to know
what happened tonight,

1005
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:04,880
and we don't have a lot
of time.

1006
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,965
I need you to talk to me,
understand?

1007
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:10,177
I'm done talking to you,
fucking whore.

1008
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,179
You're talking,
but not making sense.

1009
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,513
Clear his mind, Billy.

1010
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,158
Okay.

1011
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,627
He went, um, downstairs

1012
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:47,047
to meet Todd Lancaster.

1013
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,967
He'd called earlier

1014
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:55,097
and he told Paul
he was ready to talk.

1015
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,812
He said he was ashamed
of himself for helping us,

1016
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:04,690
but he was, um...

1017
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,776
He was more ashamed
of his father

1018
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:10,153
and just wanted it to stop.

1019
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,284
I think Paul
lost track of time

1020
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:19,746
because he looked at the clock
and he, um,

1021
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:23,000
just ran downstairs.

1022
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,003
That was, uh...

1023
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:30,173
That was the last time
I saw him.

1024
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:35,053
Did you hear any voices outside?
An altercation, maybe?

1025
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,346
No.

1026
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:39,725
Just the shots.

1027
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:46,815
I knew
I couldn't go out there.

1028
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:51,028
I knew
I couldn't call the police,

1029
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,071
couldn't be seen here.

1030
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,784
I knew everything
I couldn't do

1031
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:01,163
that Jack Valliant,
candidate for mayor,

1032
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,124
couldn't do.

1033
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,711
You know what this means, Jack?

1034
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:12,924
Yeah, it means
I let him lie out there.

1035
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,389
It means I let him die alone.

1036
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,974
It means you can handle this.

1037
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,936
Look at me, Jack.

1038
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:28,690
You are gonna be the next mayor
of New York City.

1039
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,068
You got to handle this.

1040
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,528
Now, you go get dressed.

1041
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:36,323
Find yourself a hat
and a coat with a collar.

1042
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,867
We're gonna get you out of here,
real quiet.

1043
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:45,624
Yeah? Right.

1044
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:47,626
Hostetler.

1045
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,878
We gotta get him out of here.

1046
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,838
I'm on my way.

1047
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,423
How involved are you?

1048
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,426
It's complicated.

1049
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,308
You give me a day
to gather my bearings.

1050
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,518
We'll talk.

1051
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:36,508
What a fucking mess.
A tragedy, sir.

1052
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:42,139
The press will want heads
to roll over this.

1053
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,975
I beg your pardon, sir?

1054
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,644
You know how it goes.

1055
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:50,522
We either give them an arrest
or a resignation.

1056
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,484
Then we'll have to give them
an arrest.

1057
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:00,907
<i>Tragedy in the West Village.</i>

1058
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,492
<i>Paul Andrews,</i>
<i>campaign manager</i>

1059
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,619
<i>for mayoral candidate</i>
<i>Jack Valliant,</i>

1060
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,954
<i>was found shot to death</i>

1061
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,706
<i>outside his Jane Street</i>
<i>apartment.</i>

1062
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:11,501
<i>Police questioned witnesses,</i>
<i>but no suspects were detained.</i>

1063
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:13,336
<i>Police Commissioner</i>
<i>Carl Fairbanks,</i>

1064
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:16,131
<i>a personal friend of Andrews,</i>
<i>says the investigation</i>

1065
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:19,134
<i>will receive the department's</i>
<i>highest priority.</i>

1066
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,934
He was a better man
than me.

1067
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,314
He should have been mayor.

1068
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:40,697
You and Andrews,
you were, uh, together?

1069
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:45,493
There's this quote I remember.
I don't know where I heard it.

1070
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,329
I just always remember it.

1071
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:51,917
Maybe something I read
in undergrad.

1072
01:01:55,879 --> 01:02:00,175
"And it's just not popular
or safe

1073
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:02,344
to say that I loved him."

1074
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:30,956
Have you spoken
to Councilman Valliant?

1075
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:34,042
I have.
I reached out this morning.

1076
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,378
I offered him not only
my deepest condolences,

1077
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:40,507
<i>but my personal assurance</i>
<i>that we will do all we can</i>

1078
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:43,218
<i>to bring the perpetrators</i>
<i>of this crime to justice.</i>

1079
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,053
<i>Did you know Paul Andrews?</i>

1080
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:49,182
<i>I only met Mr. Andrews</i>
<i>a few times.</i>

1081
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,643
<i>He always struck me</i>
<i>as a very genuine man,</i>

1082
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:54,145
<i>and a very hardworking man.</i>

1083
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:57,399
<i>He loved the city,</i>
<i>he loved the people.</i>

1084
01:02:57,399 --> 01:03:02,362
<i>He and my wife actually</i>
<i>were good friends.</i>

1085
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:04,072
<i>So this definitely hits home.</i>

1086
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,449
<i>Thank you all very much.</i>

1087
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,076
<i>What kind of man</i>
<i>Paul Andrews was?</i>

1088
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,869
Hang on a minute.

1089
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:13,581
<i>The kind of man who loved and</i>
<i>fought with his whole heart.</i>

1090
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,542
<i>He was a dear friend</i>
<i>to all of us,</i>

1091
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:18,295
<i>and the driving force</i>
<i>behind this campaign.</i>

1092
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:20,005
<i>He will be dearly missed.</i>

1093
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:21,756
This must be an extremely
<i>difficult time.</i>

1094
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:24,301
<i>Have you considered</i>
<i>suspending your campaign?</i>

1095
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,844
<i>No, absolutely not.</i>

1096
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:28,263
<i>The debate will continue</i>
<i>as scheduled tomorrow.</i>

1097
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:30,932
<i>The, uh, election on Tuesday.</i>

1098
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:34,102
<i>We refuse to allow some thug</i>
<i>to prevent this city</i>

1099
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:36,521
<i>from exercising</i>
<i>its democratic rights.</i>

1100
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,523
<i>Thank you.</i>

1101
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,526
Paul Andrews definitely
wasn't fucking the mayor's wife.

1102
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:45,113
We're looking for a guy
named Todd Lancaster.

1103
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:48,033
Just find what you can on him
and Bolton Village.

1104
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,951
Dig up whatever you can
on the sale.

1105
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,745
Okay. I'm on it.

1106
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:01,296
Billy.

1107
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,133
You know
it's not your fault.

1108
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,477
I gotta go.

1109
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:51,179
Sir, he just walked
into Bolton Village.

1110
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,390
Yes, sir.

1111
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:07,695
<i>Drop the gun, Mikey!</i>
<i>Drop the fucking gun!</i>

1112
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:11,366
<i>Chill, man.</i>
<i>I didn't do nothing!</i>

1113
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,159
<i>Chill, man, what the fuck?</i>

1114
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,745
<i>It's okay, Mikey.</i>
<i>We just want to talk.</i>

1115
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,250
Billy, hey.

1116
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:07,881
Oh, Billy, come in, come in.
<i>Hola.</i>

1117
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:11,092
Hi.
Where is Natalia?

1118
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,553
Actually, I came alone,
Mrs. Barea.

1119
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,847
She's been really busy
with the movie.

1120
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:18,141
Oh. Yes, the movie.

1121
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:29,944
Hi, Billy.
It's good to see you.

1122
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,237
You too.

1123
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:39,287
It's good to see you.

1124
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:44,250
So, what brings you back
to the old neighborhood?

1125
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,462
That's a good question.
I'm not really sure.

1126
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:49,797
Nostalgia can be hard
to explain.

1127
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,841
Yeah.

1128
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:57,096
Hey, is everything all right
between you and my daughter?

1129
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,807
Yeah.
Good.

1130
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:03,853
Why'd you stay here, Raul?

1131
01:07:05,313 --> 01:07:07,690
Where would we go?

1132
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,526
Anywhere.
I mean, I never got it.

1133
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,569
Natalie never got it.
How could you stay here?

1134
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:17,200
Oh, I could never leave
my Yesenia behind.

1135
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,077
She's gone, Raul.

1136
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,745
No, Billy, no.

1137
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,789
She is here.

1138
01:07:24,666 --> 01:07:29,337
Look, I know how much
you gave up that night.

1139
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:32,549
But you also gave us peace.

1140
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:40,390
And you gave Yesenia justice,
huh?

1141
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:43,643
And I can't begin
to tell you

1142
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:47,689
how much that means to me
and my wife.

1143
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:54,696
So, Billy,

1144
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:58,533
have you seen this movie?

1145
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:09,002
Raise your arms.

1146
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:10,962
Kevin.

1147
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:12,380
Give us a few moments.

1148
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,971
Thank you for meeting me.
What do you want?

1149
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,889
I wanna know
what's going on.

1150
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,933
Oh, you wanna know
what's going on now?

1151
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,394
You couldn't care less
the other night.

1152
01:08:26,394 --> 01:08:29,105
Paul Andrews was my friend,
Mr. Taggart.

1153
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:31,399
Do you understand that?

1154
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:34,569
My very dear friend.

1155
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:38,698
And if you weren't
such a cut-rate dick,

1156
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:42,076
maybe he would still
be alive today.

1157
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:44,037
But you are cut-rate.

1158
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:47,915
You're cheap to hire and you're
cheaper to throw away.

1159
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:51,419
I gave you the opportunity
to do the right thing

1160
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:53,254
and you refused.

1161
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,631
You're right.

1162
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,966
And I'm sorry about your friend,
Mrs. Hostetler.

1163
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,594
Your husband set me up.

1164
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:01,929
And I'm gonna destroy him
for it.

1165
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:03,973
I need you to understand that.

1166
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,224
I'll do whatever it takes

1167
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,809
to bring that son of a bitch
down.

1168
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:10,021
But first, you have to tell me
what's going on.

1169
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:14,233
You weren't hired to look
for my lover, Mr. Taggart.

1170
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,110
You were looking
for my source.

1171
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:21,616
I discovered some information
about the mayor a while back.

1172
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:25,119
If it was ever brought to light,
it would ruin him.

1173
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,871
I offered him a deal.

1174
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:30,333
I get a divorce,
a reasonable settlement,

1175
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:32,085
he gets my silence.

1176
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:33,795
He didn't take the deal.

1177
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,923
No. He hired you.

1178
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:39,801
It was Paul.

1179
01:09:41,052 --> 01:09:44,180
Paul gave me the information.

1180
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,807
He thought by sharing it
with me,

1181
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:47,475
he would help me
in my situation

1182
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:51,145
and I could help him
by looking into it from my side.

1183
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,438
Looking into what?

1184
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,607
The Bolton Village sale.

1185
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:57,652
Four billion dollars
is a hell of a lot of money

1186
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,737
for a few city blocks
of housing projects,

1187
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,240
wouldn't you say?
Yeah.

1188
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,159
It's worth twice that.

1189
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,495
He's a dangerous man, Billy.
No.

1190
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,123
He only knows people
that kill people.

1191
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:22,844
<i>What you got, Katy?</i>

1192
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,595
<i>A hit on Todd Lancaster.</i>

1193
01:10:24,595 --> 01:10:26,639
<i>He works for his father</i>
<i>Sam's construction</i>

1194
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:30,017
<i>and demolition company</i>
<i>called the Rochway Group.</i>

1195
01:10:30,017 --> 01:10:32,145
<i>Sam is one of the mayor's</i>
<i>biggest donors,</i>

1196
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,771
<i>which is interesting,</i>

1197
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,441
<i>because Todd is like besties</i>
<i>with Paul Andrews.</i>

1198
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:38,359
<i>Or, uh, he was, sorry.</i>

1199
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:41,571
<i>Andrews was an alumni mentor</i>
<i>to Todd at Columbia.</i>

1200
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,030
<i>He took him under his wing,</i>

1201
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,699
<i>and now they serve</i>
<i>on a bunch of boards</i>

1202
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:46,701
<i>for all these, like,</i>
<i>liberal organizations.</i>

1203
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:49,120
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>I got a home address for Todd</i>

1204
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,496
<i>out in Port Washington,</i>

1205
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,914
<i>but the office</i>
<i>is by the Navy Yard,</i>

1206
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,875
<i>so maybe</i>
<i>you wanna try there first.</i>

1207
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:57,170
<i>But, Billy, just be careful,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

1208
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:58,963
Paul Andrews was just murdered.

1209
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:02,633
<i>I'm sure it's gonna be</i>
<i>a shitstorm out there.</i>

1210
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,695
You're kidding me.
You gotta be--

1211
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:33,808
Get in here.
Get in here, you idiot.

1212
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:43,734
You are dead to me.
Look at me, you little sissy.

1213
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:46,070
You're dead to me.
Stop fucking hitting me!

1214
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:49,156
You're the reason
this is happening.

1215
01:12:50,992 --> 01:12:52,869
I'm the reason?
Get him out of here!

1216
01:12:54,829 --> 01:12:56,581
Get your fucking ape off of me!

1217
01:12:56,581 --> 01:13:01,294
Stop the shredding!
Just get this shit off of here!

1218
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:16,142
Oh, shit!

1219
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,156
Shit.

1220
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,548
Come on.

1221
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,724
Oh, fuck.

1222
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:33,052
I hope you got insurance.

1223
01:14:33,052 --> 01:14:34,929
The other guy didn't
leave his information?

1224
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:38,599
No, but we'll get him.
How you gonna manage that?

1225
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,226
That camera over there.

1226
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:43,980
How long it take
to get that footage?

1227
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,358
Depends.
You got a powerful uncle?

1228
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:48,818
I might.

1229
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:55,783
<i>Thank you for calling</i>
<i>the Roosevelt Hotel.</i>

1230
01:14:55,825 --> 01:14:57,284
What did you say?

1231
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:58,786
<i>The Roosevelt Hotel.</i>

1232
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:00,538
Yeah, I'm looking
for a Carl Fairbanks.

1233
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:02,289
<i>I'm sorry, sir,</i>

1234
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,125
<i>but the commissioner</i>
<i>hasn't set up his voicemail.</i>

1235
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,669
<i>May I take a message?</i>
<i>We done here?</i>

1236
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:08,129
Yeah, we're good.

1237
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:25,021
Found a little trouble tonight,
huh, Billy?

1238
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,773
Yeah,
you could call it that.

1239
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,275
Leave the bottle, Harry.

1240
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:35,239
You come here often?

1241
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:39,201
You trying to get
in my drawers, Billy, eh?

1242
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,078
What's next,
you're gonna ask me my sign?

1243
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,914
I bet you're the one
with two fucking faces.

1244
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:47,710
What, Gemini? Close, Billy.
I'm the bull.

1245
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:51,005
What about you?
Cancer.

1246
01:15:51,005 --> 01:15:53,591
The Roosevelt, huh?

1247
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:57,178
Pretty choice address for a cop,
even if he is commissioner.

1248
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:00,014
I made some sound investments.
Oh, I bet you did.

1249
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:01,390
Not to mention the place
on Montauk.

1250
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:04,351
That must have set you back
a few mil.

1251
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:06,145
You the new Russell Simmons
now?

1252
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:07,855
You doing yoga
and fucking white women?

1253
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:09,190
That's cute, Billy.

1254
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:11,859
Tell me something,
commissioner.

1255
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:14,779
Is the First Lady upstairs
right now?

1256
01:16:14,779 --> 01:16:16,697
Be careful, Billy.

1257
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:20,242
I know that's why you were so
concerned about those pictures.

1258
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:21,994
You were afraid
you were in them.

1259
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:24,288
That's why you took me upstairs,
not Jansen.

1260
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:26,749
What do you want?
I want Hostetler.

1261
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,959
Get in line.

1262
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:32,129
I almost had him tonight.
Papers in my trunk.

1263
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:34,048
A fucking box
full of mark-ups,

1264
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:35,716
renderings
of some New York skyline

1265
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:37,093
that doesn't exist
right now,

1266
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:38,969
but will once they tear down
Bolton Village.

1267
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,387
Some goon blindsided me.

1268
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,890
We ID'd him
from his license plate.

1269
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,433
Who is he?

1270
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:47,311
Ex-homicide cop. Dick Murdock.
You know him?

1271
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,063
Yeah,
he works for Sam Lancaster.

1272
01:16:49,063 --> 01:16:51,065
He might work
for Sam Lancaster,

1273
01:16:51,107 --> 01:16:53,234
but he's on Hostetler's payroll.

1274
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:54,819
Say again?

1275
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,237
That paperwork
you got in your trunk,

1276
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:57,905
not to diminish
your new beauty mark,

1277
01:16:57,905 --> 01:16:59,907
is fucking worthless.

1278
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:01,659
Everyone knows Solstein Donagan

1279
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:04,954
is gonna tear down
Bolton Village.

1280
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:07,456
A few know they hired
the Rochway Group to do it.

1281
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:10,751
So why is Paul Andrews dead
if it was such an open secret?

1282
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,586
Well, he was about
to figure out the rest.

1283
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,714
What "rest"?
What fucking "rest"?

1284
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:17,091
Doesn't anybody in this town

1285
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:19,385
speak in complete
fucking sentences anymore?

1286
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:23,806
Todd Lancaster was meeting
with Andrews that night

1287
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:25,766
to bring him a contract.

1288
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:29,270
Somebody didn't want that
to happen.

1289
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:31,897
I myself almost secured
the contract from Todd,

1290
01:17:31,897 --> 01:17:33,607
but now he's not talking.

1291
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:35,734
He's scared.

1292
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,528
Well, the contract
is proof of the deal

1293
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,280
to tear down Bolton Village.

1294
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:42,783
That's part of it.

1295
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,830
Only Todd Lancaster
knows the other part.

1296
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:50,833
Harry.

1297
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,042
Whatever he wants,
on me.

1298
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:54,378
Good night, commissioner.

1299
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:56,338
Good night, commissioner.

1300
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:05,556
<i>Places, everyone.</i>

1301
01:18:05,556 --> 01:18:07,266
We're live in five.

1302
01:18:11,061 --> 01:18:12,771
Good evening, New York.

1303
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:16,025
Welcome to the third and final
New York City mayoral debate.

1304
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:18,611
At this time, join me
in welcoming our candidates,

1305
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:21,572
Mayor Nicholas Hostetler
and Councilman Jack Valliant.

1306
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,959
Hey. How much?

1307
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:35,961
Manual windows?
Yeah.

1308
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,047
That's how you got
those masculine forearms.

1309
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:40,132
Where do you think,
from stroking your ego?

1310
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,802
Big booty, good.
Big forearms, no good.

1311
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:45,971
Let me drive.
What the fuck?

1312
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:47,348
Asshole!
I didn't do it on purpose.

1313
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:49,516
Let me drive.
Oh, my God!

1314
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,769
You ruin my car
before you even drive it.

1315
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:53,395
I apologize.
Where are we going?

1316
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,898
Don't worry. Get in.
What do you think I'm doing?

1317
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,900
Whoa, where'd you get
these seat covers,

1318
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,276
the Gaza Strip?

1319
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:00,945
In a Valliant administration,

1320
01:19:00,945 --> 01:19:03,280
we will be focusing
on two key principles:

1321
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,325
Shared responsibility
and shared sacrifice.

1322
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:08,494
<i>For those of you</i>
<i>who were fortunate enough</i>

1323
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:11,247
<i>to earn more</i>
<i>than $200,000 a year,</i>

1324
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:13,249
<i>we'll ask that you pay</i>
<i>a little more in taxes.</i>

1325
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:16,168
<i>For those of you who don't,</i>

1326
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:17,628
well, we'll bring down
the payroll tax.

1327
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:19,296
It's responsible
and it moves us forward

1328
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:21,757
towards a balanced budget,
and a secure future.

1329
01:19:23,384 --> 01:19:24,718
Mayor.

1330
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:27,471
I think it is laughable
that my opponent can be up here

1331
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:31,141
espousing fiscal responsibility
when it is a known fact

1332
01:19:31,141 --> 01:19:32,935
he has never met a tax
he didn't want to raise.

1333
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:37,189
This coming from the man
whose policies landed us

1334
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:38,565
in a billion-dollar deficit.

1335
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:42,695
This is coming from the mayor
who got us out of it.

1336
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,447
By selling people's homes out
from underneath them.

1337
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:49,076
By selling public housing
to a Wall Street equity firm.

1338
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:51,036
I believe
the residents of Bolton Village

1339
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:52,788
would have much preferred
a tax increase

1340
01:19:52,788 --> 01:19:54,581
to an eviction notice.

1341
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,501
Councilman, no matter where
a New Yorker lives,

1342
01:19:57,501 --> 01:20:00,296
nobody wants a tax increase.

1343
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:01,880
Nor do I.

1344
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:05,551
It's time you told the truth
about the Bolton Village deal.

1345
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:09,221
Here's the truth.
We have a $3 billion surplus.

1346
01:20:09,221 --> 01:20:13,017
We can use that
to put our people back to work.

1347
01:20:13,017 --> 01:20:17,146
We can use that
to bring tax relief to folks.

1348
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:18,731
That's the truth.

1349
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:21,400
No, that's not the truth.
Not even close to the truth.

1350
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:24,069
You made a sweetheart deal
with Solstein Donagan

1351
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:25,738
to line your own pockets.

1352
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:30,034
To buy your way out of a deficit
your broken policies created.

1353
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,744
<i>The truth is</i>
<i>you continue to lie</i>

1354
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:35,080
to the good people of this city
<i>about their intentions.</i>

1355
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:37,499
<i>Solstein Donagan did not buy</i>
<i>Bolton Village</i>

1356
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,501
<i>to get</i>
<i>into the landlord business.</i>

1357
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,628
<i>Solstein Donagan</i>
<i>bought Bolton Village</i>

1358
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:43,547
<i>to get</i>
<i>into the skyline business,</i>

1359
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:44,923
pure and simple.

1360
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:47,217
Peter, we've gone into the area
of slander.

1361
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:49,845
Solstein Donagan,
in their 50-year history,

1362
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:53,098
has never bought a property
intended for residential use

1363
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:55,100
and I highly doubt
they intend to start now.

1364
01:20:55,142 --> 01:20:58,228
I don't know how much clearer
I can make it for you.

1365
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:00,647
<i>To the people</i>
<i>of Bolton Village,</i>

1366
01:21:00,647 --> 01:21:03,734
<i>there is only one reason</i>
<i>I got into this deal.</i>

1367
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:05,277
Because I want better for you.

1368
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:08,280
There is a new day dawning
in Bolton Village.

1369
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:09,990
<i>And if Solstein Donagan,</i>

1370
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,492
if they step out of line,

1371
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:13,744
if they don't fulfill
their promises,

1372
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:17,706
<i>then I will smack them</i>
<i>back into shape.</i>

1373
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,375
<i>That is my oath.</i>

1374
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,085
Unfortunately for you,
mayor,

1375
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,961
we're all well aware
of what that oath is worth.

1376
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:25,547
The fact remains,
the debt is gone.

1377
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,800
There are other ways
to move us towards solvency.

1378
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:29,426
Name one.
Besides larceny?

1379
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:30,928
I tell you
what I would have done.

1380
01:21:30,928 --> 01:21:32,679
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>I would have done something</i>

1381
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:34,807
<i>my opponent clearly feels</i>
<i>is beneath him,</i>

1382
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:37,643
and that is to seek the counsel
of my betters

1383
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:39,228
on this crucial issue.

1384
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:40,646
I would've convened
a panel of...

1385
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:43,774
Respected economists.
...to help us solve this.

1386
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:45,442
We all know
about that panel.

1387
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:48,529
That same panel put us
into default in the '80s.

1388
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:50,239
New Yorkers need more
than a panel.

1389
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,573
They want solutions.

1390
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:53,617
And there is only one person
up on this stage

1391
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:55,786
in the business
of providing solutions.

1392
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:58,163
The other one who's up here
is in the business of saying

1393
01:21:58,205 --> 01:21:59,998
how dire the situation is.
Is this a debate?

1394
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:04,128
<i>Are we being treated</i>
<i>to a Nick Hostetler soliloquy?</i>

1395
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,712
The issue is dire.

1396
01:22:05,712 --> 01:22:08,590
Because you and your cronies
have rigged the game.

1397
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,885
Honest, hardworking
New Yorkers recognize

1398
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,178
that nothing will change.

1399
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:15,013
Nothing will ever change

1400
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:17,057
if we continue to elect men
like this.

1401
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:19,685
Tell me things have not changed.

1402
01:22:19,685 --> 01:22:23,939
When I was elected mayor,
this was a broken city.

1403
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,441
Broken.

1404
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:28,360
Step by step,
I've been getting it fixed.

1405
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:32,114
Bolton Village is just
another one of those steps.

1406
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:33,365
Tell me things haven't changed.

1407
01:22:33,407 --> 01:22:34,783
I just stood before you all

1408
01:22:34,783 --> 01:22:37,202
and told you
we have a $3 billion surplus.

1409
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,538
Peter--
Tell me things haven't changed.

1410
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:41,373
No other mayor in the history
of this city

1411
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,417
has been able to say that.

1412
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:44,960
Tell me things haven't changed.

1413
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,754
When you step out of your house
with your children,

1414
01:22:47,754 --> 01:22:50,299
you take them to the parks,
do you feel safe?

1415
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,758
Yes, you do feel safe

1416
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:54,386
because I get your letters
and I know you do.

1417
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:58,056
That's us, working together,
getting it fixed.

1418
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:00,100
Tell me things haven't changed.

1419
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,393
That's right, mayor.

1420
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:08,609
Councilman Valliant, the
original question still remains.

1421
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:11,361
What would you have done
to reverse the debt?

1422
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:15,240
Like--
Don't worry about it.
Nicky fixed it.

1423
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:31,256
Two honks for trouble.
Got it.

1424
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,258
Lean your seat back all the way.
Okay.

1425
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,219
I'll be right back.

1426
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:02,788
You know who I am?
No.

1427
01:24:02,788 --> 01:24:07,125
I know who you are, Todd.
You're a fucking piece of shit!

1428
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,961
You set up Andrews to die.
No. No.

1429
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:10,212
You set him up!

1430
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,256
You arranged that meeting
and lured him out.

1431
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:14,716
No, I didn't.
You let him walk into an ambush.

1432
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,843
I didn't kill him.
You want to play games with me?

1433
01:24:16,843 --> 01:24:19,471
Shut your fucking mouth!
You're a fucking liar.

1434
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:20,806
I didn't kill him.
Liar.

1435
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:23,642
I'm not a liar.
You want to lie to me?

1436
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:25,477
I'm not lying.

1437
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,396
He was my friend.
What?

1438
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:29,773
He was my friend!
Get up!

1439
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:31,233
Now!

1440
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,903
Tell me
what the fuck is going on!

1441
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:37,072
Please stop hitting me!

1442
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,825
I didn't know.

1443
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:42,202
I was just there
to give him something.

1444
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:45,622
I was down on the corner,
waiting for him.

1445
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:49,042
I saw him coming down the stairs
and I waved, okay?

1446
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:51,920
I was gonna give him something
to help Valliant win.

1447
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,299
To help Valliant bring down
that son of a bitch Hostetler!

1448
01:24:55,299 --> 01:24:56,633
That doesn't make any sense.

1449
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,343
Hostetler's
your father's friend.

1450
01:24:58,343 --> 01:25:01,305
Fuck my father!

1451
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:03,390
I had the contract
in my hand.

1452
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:09,688
Paul, he saw me waving
and he smiled.

1453
01:25:11,273 --> 01:25:14,484
Murdock must have followed me
in his car,

1454
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:16,528
then he got out
and he shot him, man.

1455
01:25:16,528 --> 01:25:18,530
He shot him
in the fucking head.

1456
01:25:18,572 --> 01:25:20,407
And then he showed up to work
the next day

1457
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:22,242
like nothing happened.

1458
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:24,703
Todd, it's all right.
Look at me. Look at me.

1459
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:26,747
Calm down, okay?

1460
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:28,373
Where's that contract?

1461
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:40,844
Take it.

1462
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:43,597
I don't want it anymore.

1463
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:52,230
You sure you're ready to do this
to your father?

1464
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,566
Yeah. Ah.

1465
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,735
Shit.

1466
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:58,028
Get upstairs. Go.

1467
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:35,190
That was an accident.

1468
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,942
It's Taggart.
Just calm down.

1469
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,944
Motherfucking fuck!

1470
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,695
Are you okay?

1471
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:25,240
Yeah.

1472
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,118
Are you okay?

1473
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:29,494
Yeah, I'm all right.

1474
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:09,284
You got those reporters'
e-mail addresses?

1475
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,161
Yep.

1476
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:12,954
Billy,
are you sure about this?

1477
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:17,250
If you don't hear from me
in two hours, send that e-mail.

1478
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:19,586
Okay.

1479
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:24,508
Thanks for being there, Katy.

1480
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:27,886
Every time.

1481
01:28:42,526 --> 01:28:43,819
<i>May I help you?</i>

1482
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:46,071
Yeah, tell the mayor
it's Billy Taggart.

1483
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:48,073
<i>One moment, please.</i>

1484
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,013
Mr. Mayor.

1485
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:14,891
Billy.

1486
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:18,603
What a nice surprise.
Thank you, Valerie.

1487
01:29:18,645 --> 01:29:22,107
VCR.
I haven't used one in years.

1488
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:26,862
Take your coat?
No, I'm good.

1489
01:29:26,862 --> 01:29:29,906
Billy, you're looking
worse for wear.

1490
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:32,492
I got into a bit
of a thing.

1491
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:35,954
Well,
I'm glad you made it out.

1492
01:29:37,163 --> 01:29:39,124
Drink?
Yeah, make it a double.

1493
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:41,459
Attaboy, Billy.

1494
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:44,087
All right.

1495
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:51,887
So how did Fitzgerald say it?

1496
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:53,805
"To the orgiastic future

1497
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:57,142
that year by year recedes
before us."

1498
01:29:57,183 --> 01:29:58,643
Cheers.

1499
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:04,524
I don't even know
what that means.

1500
01:30:04,524 --> 01:30:06,568
Me neither.

1501
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:09,946
What can I do for you,
Billy?

1502
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:12,824
I wanna know
why you hired me.

1503
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:15,160
Stick with
the adultery narrative.

1504
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:16,411
It's sexier.

1505
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:18,079
Lies are always sexier.

1506
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,999
I've had enough this week
to last a lifetime,

1507
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:23,293
so why don't you just tell me
the fucking truth?

1508
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:31,384
The truth is I hired you
to investigate my wife.

1509
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:33,178
Investigate her for what?

1510
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:36,848
For not minding her own business
is for what.

1511
01:30:36,848 --> 01:30:39,851
For having a big mouth
is for what.

1512
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:42,103
For asking too many questions
is for what.

1513
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,189
Better be careful
following her example, Billy,

1514
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:47,442
I might have to hire someone
to investigate you.

1515
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,694
Who? Your boy Murdock?

1516
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:54,074
I don't think he's available
for the job.

1517
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:55,575
I hope he didn't suffer.

1518
01:30:55,575 --> 01:30:57,661
No more than Andrews did.

1519
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:59,871
Damn shame what happened
to that man.

1520
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,540
So tell me, did you really think
I'd let you turn me

1521
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:05,377
into an accessory to murder?
For $50,000?

1522
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:08,213
Did you think
I wouldn't ask any questions?

1523
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:10,006
Or that I wouldn't get
any answers?

1524
01:31:10,006 --> 01:31:12,217
What answers have you got,
Billy?

1525
01:31:12,258 --> 01:31:14,928
Andrews was about to link you
to Bolton Village.

1526
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:17,347
That's the reason
you got rid of him.

1527
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:20,016
No, sir. Not me.
Oh, not you.

1528
01:31:20,016 --> 01:31:22,185
The man you hired.
Murdock.

1529
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:24,229
Try getting that testimony.

1530
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:27,732
Yeah. You're good, mayor.
I give you that.

1531
01:31:27,774 --> 01:31:29,025
You got it all worked out,
huh?

1532
01:31:29,025 --> 01:31:31,486
The denial
about Bolton Village.

1533
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,780
The discount
to Solstein Donagan.

1534
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:36,324
The new big contract
to the Rochway Group.

1535
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:39,035
But nobody can do a damn thing
about it, huh?

1536
01:31:39,035 --> 01:31:41,705
Because anybody that could
is either dead or bought.

1537
01:31:41,705 --> 01:31:44,249
I'm fucking impressed, mayor.
You're good.

1538
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:48,670
Perhaps that's why the people
keep electing me, Billy.

1539
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,839
Because I simply
get the job done.

1540
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:53,758
So all this,
it was all for the city?

1541
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,136
Everything I do
is for this great city.

1542
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:59,472
The city doesn't own 50 percent
of Rochway Group, mayor.

1543
01:31:59,472 --> 01:32:00,932
You do.

1544
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,727
Look what I got.

1545
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:10,775
What you got in your hand?

1546
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:12,652
It's your fucking jugular,
mayor.

1547
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:19,492
Fifty percent of $4 billion
is a lot of fucking money.

1548
01:32:19,492 --> 01:32:21,119
So here's how this works.

1549
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:24,789
I got an e-mail in my outbox
with a copy of that contract.

1550
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:26,082
I click one button,

1551
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:27,959
a hundred newsmen
will read your name

1552
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:30,920
alongside Sam Lancaster's
in black and white.

1553
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,548
Don't worry, I got the original
nice and safe.

1554
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:36,051
You resign, you step down,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

1555
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:38,178
Those e-mails will never see
the light of day.

1556
01:32:38,178 --> 01:32:41,347
But that Bolton Village deal
is dead.

1557
01:32:41,347 --> 01:32:43,808
You want to tear down
other projects as a civilian,

1558
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:46,311
so be it,
but Bolton Village stands,

1559
01:32:46,352 --> 01:32:48,271
and you're gonna walk away.

1560
01:32:48,271 --> 01:32:50,690
That's the deal, mayor.
I suggest you take it.

1561
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,150
Counter offer.

1562
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:53,234
No need.

1563
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,028
I got nothing left
for you to threaten.

1564
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:58,448
I want the originals,
I want all the copies,

1565
01:32:58,448 --> 01:33:02,535
and I want your case file
by 9 a.m. tomorrow.

1566
01:33:02,535 --> 01:33:04,162
You're done, motherfucker.

1567
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:05,163
You are done.

1568
01:33:05,205 --> 01:33:08,041
You ever spend
a goddamn minute

1569
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:11,294
thinking why I chose you,
Taggart?

1570
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:14,589
And I did choose you.

1571
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:16,007
I chose you.

1572
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:20,178
Because I own you.

1573
01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:24,349
You're gonna have to excuse
the quality of the videotape.

1574
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:26,351
It was shot
on one of those camcorders

1575
01:33:26,392 --> 01:33:31,231
they used to sell you 40 bucks
on Eighth Avenue.

1576
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:33,441
But I think you're about to see
the bigger picture.

1577
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:38,571
<i>Hey, yo! First off,</i>
<i>let me say welcome.</i>

1578
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:39,948
<i>Welcome to Bolton Village.</i>

1579
01:33:39,948 --> 01:33:41,658
What the fuck is this?

1580
01:33:41,658 --> 01:33:44,869
<i>- What's your name, fool?</i>
<i>- They call me Alex.</i>

1581
01:33:44,911 --> 01:33:46,287
What the fuck is this?

1582
01:33:48,373 --> 01:33:49,958
<i>We just cooling out.</i>

1583
01:33:49,958 --> 01:33:51,960
<i>Me and my man David</i>
<i>on the camcorder.</i>

1584
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,294
<i>Yes, it's David, hello.</i>

1585
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:58,091
<i>I got a pocket full of cash</i>

1586
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:00,135
<i>and we looking</i>
<i>to have some fun.</i>

1587
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:01,845
<i>We gonna hit up</i>
<i>the usual spots,</i>

1588
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:04,597
<i>maybe get</i>
<i>into something unusual.</i>

1589
01:34:04,597 --> 01:34:08,226
<i>Drop the gun, Mikey!</i>
<i>Drop the fucking gun!</i>

1590
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:11,271
<i>Drop the fucking gun!</i>

1591
01:34:11,271 --> 01:34:13,815
<i>Chill, man, what the fuck?</i>
<i>Mikey, we just wanna talk.</i>

1592
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:26,703
Drop the gun, Mikey.
Drop the fucking gun.

1593
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:29,414
It's okay, Mikey.
We just wanna talk.

1594
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:36,462
Oh, shit, man!
Get the fuck out of here!

1595
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:53,855
<i>Oh, shit, man!</i>
<i>Get the fuck out of here!</i>

1596
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:00,236
How's your memory now,
Billy?

1597
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:07,410
Now there's something
that your average citizen...

1598
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:12,874
...just wouldn't understand.

1599
01:35:12,874 --> 01:35:14,792
But I do.

1600
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:20,590
You see,
we take because we can.

1601
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:26,304
We take
because it feels good.

1602
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:30,016
The only difference
between you and I

1603
01:35:30,016 --> 01:35:33,061
is that you've gone
and done it on videotape.

1604
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:34,604
Like I was saying,
I want the original,

1605
01:35:34,604 --> 01:35:39,317
all the copies, your case file
by the morning.

1606
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:41,194
You can have this copy.

1607
01:35:41,194 --> 01:35:45,531
I transferred it to disk
seven years ago.

1608
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:56,501
Nat?

1609
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:13,077
We take because it feels good.

1610
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:15,413
<i>The only difference</i>
<i>between you and I</i>

1611
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:19,417
<i>is that you've gone</i>
<i>and done it on videotape.</i>

1612
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:22,170
<i>Like I was saying,</i>
<i>I want the original,</i>

1613
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:25,631

1614
01:37:25,631 --> 01:37:28,509
<i>You can have this copy.</i>

1615
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:31,929
<i>I transferred it to disk</i>
<i>seven years ago.</i>

1616
01:37:35,725 --> 01:37:38,895
He'll ruin you if you do this.
You know that, Billy.

1617
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:40,938
Use it.

1618
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:43,691
There's no statute
of limitations on murder.

1619
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:45,068
If I go with this,

1620
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:46,778
I can't cut it down
to protect you.

1621
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:48,488
I'm not asking you to.

1622
01:37:52,742 --> 01:37:54,744
You sure?

1623
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:58,081
Time to square the debt.

1624
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:06,089
Ladies and gentlemen,

1625
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:07,965
unaccustomed as I am
to public speaking--

1626
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:09,884
I know you, Sam,
you like a debate.

1627
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:11,427
How did you enjoy that one?

1628
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:12,720
Masterful.

1629
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,430
Thank you very, very much.

1630
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:16,349
Firstly, I'd like to thank you
for coming.

1631
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:21,020
This is a room full of my wife
and I's very, very good friends,

1632
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:22,522
so thank you.

1633
01:38:22,522 --> 01:38:24,357
A man much smarter than me
once said

1634
01:38:24,357 --> 01:38:27,944
that politics is the art
of the possible.

1635
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,278
This afternoon,

1636
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:33,116
Jack Valliant was ordering
stationery.

1637
01:38:33,116 --> 01:38:34,951
Tonight, he's looking
for the number of the bus

1638
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:36,452
that hit him.

1639
01:38:36,494 --> 01:38:38,287
He fought a good fight,
but he was boxing shadows.

1640
01:38:38,287 --> 01:38:40,581
He was like Roberto Duran
out there.

1641
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:43,501
<i>"No mas, Nicky, no mas.</i>
<i>Don't hit me no more."</i>

1642
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:46,212
He says it's urgent.
I'll deal with this.

1643
01:38:46,212 --> 01:38:48,840
Don't go anywhere.
I have a lot of people to thank.

1644
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,425
Yes?
<i>- It's me.</i>

1645
01:38:50,425 --> 01:38:53,428
Billy, I didn't think
you'd call me so soon.

1646
01:38:53,428 --> 01:38:55,555
<i>Look out your window now,</i>
<i>mayor.</i>

1647
01:38:55,555 --> 01:38:58,766
<i>It's your future.</i>
<i>I think your ride's here, Nick.</i>

1648
01:39:05,148 --> 01:39:06,649
Nicholas Hostetler,

1649
01:39:06,691 --> 01:39:10,570
you're under arrest
for the murder of Paul Andrews.

1650
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:12,363
You have the right
to remain silent.

1651
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:14,657
Anything you say
can be used against you.

1652
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:17,326
Anything I say will
be used against you, Carl.

1653
01:39:17,326 --> 01:39:18,744
You have the right
to an attorney.

1654
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:20,746
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided.

1655
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:22,415
Attorneys?

1656
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:24,333
They'll pull your dental records
when I'm done with you.

1657
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:25,918
Do you understand
these rights?

1658
01:39:25,918 --> 01:39:28,296
I understand you're suicidal.

1659
01:39:28,296 --> 01:39:31,007
You may have forgotten
how you got your job, I haven't.

1660
01:39:31,048 --> 01:39:33,468
Do you really think
a jury of my peers

1661
01:39:33,468 --> 01:39:35,887
in New York City
will convict me?

1662
01:39:35,887 --> 01:39:39,432
I'm just the handcuffs guy.

1663
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:44,353
Don't wait up, dear.
Have I ever?

1664
01:39:49,317 --> 01:39:51,694
I guess
we both misjudged Billy.

1665
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:54,197
Then again,
you misjudged a lot of us.

1666
01:39:54,197 --> 01:39:55,531
We thought
Billy would roll over,

1667
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:58,784
that Andrews was sleeping
with your wife.

1668
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:00,536
You thought I wasn't.

1669
01:40:32,735 --> 01:40:34,737
<i>New Yorkers have been</i>
<i>put through an ordeal</i>

1670
01:40:34,737 --> 01:40:36,280
<i>these last few days,</i>

1671
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,907
<i>beginning with the murder</i>
<i>of Paul Andrews,</i>

1672
01:40:37,949 --> 01:40:39,575
<i>your campaign manager,</i>

1673
01:40:39,617 --> 01:40:42,119
<i>and culminating last night</i>
<i>with the arrest of Hostetler</i>

1674
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:43,538
<i>in connection</i>
<i>with that crime.</i>

1675
01:40:43,538 --> 01:40:45,081
<i>What would you say</i>
<i>to New Yorkers</i>

1676
01:40:45,122 --> 01:40:47,708
<i>who, quite frankly,</i>
<i>have lost faith</i>

1677
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:49,293
<i>in their government?</i>

1678
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:52,004
<i>Well, days like these</i>
<i>can shake your faith...</i>

1679
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:53,506
Rachael.
- Hey.

1680
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:55,758
You staying out of trouble?
- I'm trying.

1681
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,385
Yeah, I know it.

1682
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:01,806
Whatever he's drinking.

1683
01:41:09,438 --> 01:41:10,856
Tomorrow's the big day, huh?

1684
01:41:14,235 --> 01:41:17,321
Looks like our guy's a lock.

1685
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:23,828
To Jack Valliant.

1686
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:28,791
A good man.

1687
01:41:43,014 --> 01:41:46,642
I, uh, I got you this.

1688
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:48,144
What is it?

1689
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:50,730
What's it look like?
It's a phone card.

1690
01:41:54,734 --> 01:41:56,652
Thank you.

1691
01:41:57,987 --> 01:42:00,781
Every time, Billy.

1692
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:10,958
It's okay, Katy.
I'll be home real soon.

1693
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:12,585
I'll be here.

1694
01:42:12,585 --> 01:42:14,378
Come on, Billy.

1695
01:42:15,463 --> 01:42:17,173
We'll take the long way.
