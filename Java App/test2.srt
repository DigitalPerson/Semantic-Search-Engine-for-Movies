No. You should try it.

Women call men dogs.

328
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,598
They mean it to suggest we're somehow

329
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,516
untrustworthy or disloyal.

336

He used to be a cop.

649

Get out of here. WOMAN:
That's how you two met?

650
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,161
You promised not to write her a ticket

651
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,496
if she goes out with you.

652
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,414
Yeah, something like that.

654
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,209
RYAN: Come on, Billy.

655
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,878
How'd a guy like you end up
with a girl like Natalie?

656
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,213
A guy like me?

657
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,674
I can't imagine you're big on theater.

658
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:19,260
Look, this is your guys' party.
Let's talk about your movie.

659
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,553
No one leaves this table

660
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,722
without singing the blues, Billy.

661
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,015
Natalie, pick up the slack.

662
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,642
How'd you meet this charming guy?

663
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,936
Billy was a friend of the family.

664
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,105
You lived in the same neighborhood?

665
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,023
NATALIE: He worked by where I lived.

666

RYAN: You fell in love with
the neighborhood policeman?

667
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,403
Come on.

668
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:37,862
We were a bunch of broke Puerto Ricans

669
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,740
nobody gave a damn about.
Billy was good to us.

670
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,034
Barrow. Is that Puerto Rican?

671
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,328
It's actually Barea.

672
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,122
Natalie Barea.

673
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,707
Natalia.

674
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,750
MAN: That has a nice ring to it.

675
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,294
You changed it so you could
play more Anglo?

676
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,755
No.

677
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:59,259
I changed it because I was tired
of going to auditions

678
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:01,928
and the first question out of
the casting director's mouth

679
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:06,307
was if I was related to Yesenia Barea.

680

MAN: Who's that?

681
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:08,852
My sister.

682
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,437
MAN: Is she famous or something?

683
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:13,231
Yeah. Her face was in all the
papers seven years ago.

684
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,524
Nat, please--

685
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:15,859
NATALIE: Beautiful 16-year-old girl,

686
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,277
raped and beaten to death

687
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,529
in an apartment in Bolton Village.

688
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,620
Billy was good to us.

689
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:32,917
It was a really hard time
and he made it better.

690
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,887
VALLIANT: Sure, that's because
you like to accuse anyone

691
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,639
who doesn't let the rich off,
of engaging in class warfare

692
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,141
when in reality,

693
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,185
you know full well what
real class warfare is.

694
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,520
That's stealing homes of working people

695
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,314
and handing them over at a cut rate

696
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,523
to an investment bank.

697
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,650
That, sir, is real class warfare.

698
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,611
Maybe where you grew up in Connecticut,

699
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,654
$3 billion is considered cut-rate.

700
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,198
But here in New York City,

701
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:04,949
$3 billion is a lot of money

702
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,659
that can solve a lot of problems.

703
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,453
You don't solve problems

704
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:09,788
by bending over for billionaires.

705
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,915
I may bend over for billionaires,

706
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,167
but you come from a long line of them.

707
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,504
How are the renovations coming
on that $4 million townhouse

708
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,755
in Brooklyn Heights?

709
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:22,008
You want my house too? Take it.

710
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,177
I'm upside-down on my mortgage
like the rest of this city.

711
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:27,180
Because the system has been
rigged by men like you.

712
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,893
Fuck, that's good.

713
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,645
Yeah? You make that stick,

714
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,271
you pull undecideds off the fence.

715
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,524
Okay.

716
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,359
We need that moment, Paul.

717
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,071
That "You are no Jack Kennedy" moment.

718
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,697
It has to be Bolton Village related.

719
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,825
Stick to the issues,

720
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,827
people will see the difference
between you two.

721
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,079
It's not clean enough, Paul.
It's gotta be clean cut.

722
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,164
He's got this clear line of attack on me.

723
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,625
I'm the rich Connecticut carpetbagger.

724

What the hell is he?

725
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:58,086
He's out of a job,

726
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,921
if you stick to the fucking issues.

727
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,215
You're missing the point. He's a crook!

728
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,842
I need to hammer that home

729
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:06,845
when he taunts me about my family money

730
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,179
and Harvard and the rest.

731
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,098
I need to be able to lay
his fat ass flat.

732
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,725
"You, sir, are a crook. And a liar."

And if tries to challenge me to prove it,

734
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,230

and read it out loud.

dump truck of shit on me

and our campaign has piss-all
in the way of pushback.

I thought that's what Montauk was for.

Where are our headlines?

We don't need headlines, Jack.

Because we're winning.

Even their internal polling
has us up by three.

By selling public housing to
a Wall Street equity firm.

1446
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,078
I believe the residents of Bolton Village

1447
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,830
would have much preferred a tax increase

1448

1449
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,543
Councilman, no matter where
a New Yorker lives,

1450
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:00,337
nobody wants a tax increase.

the Bolton Village deal.

Here's the truth. We have
a $3 billion surplus.

1454
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:13,058
We can use that to put our
people back to work.

1455
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:17,187
We can use that to bring
tax relief to folks.

even close to the truth.

the area of slander.

1469
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:49,887
Solstein Donagan, in their
50-year history,

1470
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:53,140
has never bought a property intended
for residential use

1471
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:55,142

intend to start now.

01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,786

1480

<i>then I will smack them back into shape.</i>

1481

<i>That is my oath.</i>

1482

Unfortunately for you, mayor,

we're all well aware of what
that oath is worth.

1484
01:21:23,003 --> 01:21:25,589
The fact remains, the debt is gone.

1485
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:27,841
There are other ways to move
us towards solvency.

Name one. Besides larceny?

1487

1492
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,687
I would've convened a panel of...

Respected economists. ...to
help us solve this.

1494

We all know about that panel.

1495

That same panel put us into
default in the '80s.

1496
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,280
New Yorkers need more than a panel.

1498

is. Is this a debate?

A man much smarter than me once said

1759
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:27,985
that politics is the art of the possible.

1760
01:38:28,027 --> 01:38:29,320
This afternoon,

1761
01:38:29,362 --> 01:38:33,157
Jack Valliant was ordering stationery.

1762
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:34,992
Tonight, he's looking for
the number of the bus

1763
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:36,494
that hit him.

1764
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:38,329
He fought a good fight, but
he was boxing shadows.

1765
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:40,623
He was like Roberto Duran out there.

1766
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:43,543
<i>"No mas, Nicky, no mas.</i>
<i>Don't hit me no more."</i>

1767
01:38:43,543 --> 01:38:46,254
He says it's urgent. I'll deal with this.

1768
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:48,881
Don't go anywhere. I have
a lot of people to thank.

1769
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:50,466
Yes? BILLY: It's me.

1770
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:53,469
Billy, I didn't think you'd
call me so soon.

1771
01:38:53,469 --> 01:38:55,596
<i>Look out your window now, mayor.</i>

1772
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:58,808
<i>It's your future. I think</i>
<i>your ride's here, Nick.</i>

1773
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:06,691
Nicholas Hostetler,

1774
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:10,611
you're under arrest for the
murder of Paul Andrews.

1775
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:12,405
You have the right to remain silent.

1776
01:39:12,405 --> 01:39:14,699
Anything you say can be used against you.

1777
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:17,368
Anything I say will be used
against you, Carl.

1778
01:39:17,368 --> 01:39:18,786
You have the right to an attorney.

1779
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:20,788
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided.

1780
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:22,457
Attorneys?

1781
01:39:22,457 --> 01:39:24,375
They'll pull your dental records
when I'm done with you.

1782
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:25,960
Do you understand these rights?

1783
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,337
I understand you're suicidal.

1784
01:39:28,337 --> 01:39:31,048
You may have forgotten how you
got your job, I haven't.

1785
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:33,509
Do you really think a jury of my peers

1786
01:39:33,509 --> 01:39:35,928
in New York City will convict me?

1787
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:39,474
I'm just the handcuffs guy.

1788
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:44,395
Don't wait up, dear. Have I ever?

1789
01:39:49,358 --> 01:39:51,736
I guess we both misjudged Billy.

1790
01:39:51,777 --> 01:39:54,238
Then again, you misjudged a lot of us.

1791
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:55,573
We thought Billy would roll over,

1792
01:39:55,573 --> 01:39:58,826
that Andrews was sleeping with your wife.

1793
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:00,578
You thought I wasn't.

1794

RACHAEL: I'm trying.

Yeah, I know it.
