1
00:00:00,441 --> 00:00:01,985
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,144
You make jumps
you can't explain, Will.

3
00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:07,398
- The evidence explains.
- Then help me find some evidence.

4
00:00:07,432 --> 00:00:08,933
I wouldn't put him out there!

5
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:10,434
Should he get too close,
I need you to make sure

6
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:12,303
he's not out there alone.

7
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,154
I don't think the Shrike
killed that girl in the field.

8
00:00:14,206 --> 00:00:16,574
This girl's killer thought
that she was a pig.

9
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:18,610
You think this was a copycat?

10
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:20,611
I think I can help
good Will see his face.

11
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:23,247
- Hello?
- They know.

12
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:25,165
(gunshots)

13
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:27,918
You said he wouldn't get
too close.

14
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:30,971
See?

15
00:00:38,146 --> 00:00:40,146
(gunshots)

16
00:01:06,157 --> 00:01:09,043
(Hobbs' daughter gasping)

17
00:01:09,094 --> 00:01:10,628
(Hobbs): <i>See?</i>

18
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:13,597
(Hobbs' daughter gasping) <i>See?</i>

19
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:22,139
We're here.

20
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:30,614
(police radio chatter)

21
00:02:39,968 --> 00:02:41,552
Could be

22
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:45,272
a permanent installation
in your Evil Minds Museum.

23
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:48,108
Well, what we learn
about Garrett Jacob Hobbs will

24
00:02:48,143 --> 00:02:50,444
help us catch the next one
like him.

25
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:53,764
There's still seven bodies
unaccounted for.

26
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:56,600
Yeah, well, he was eating them.

27
00:02:56,618 --> 00:02:58,952
Had to be some parts
he wasn't eating.

28
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:02,322
Not necessarily.

29
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:06,293
All right, what if Hobbs
wasn't eating alone? It's a lot of work.

30
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:09,079
Disappearing these girls,
butchering them, and then

31
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:11,582
not leaving a shred of anything
other than what's in this room.

32
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:14,468
- Someone he hunted with.
- Someone who is in a coma,

33
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:18,472
who also happened to be someone
he hunted with.

34
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:31,468
Abigail Hobbs is a suspect?

35
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,987
We've been conducting
house-to-house interviews

36
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:37,524
at the Hobbs residence,
and, uh, at this property also.

37
00:03:41,162 --> 00:03:44,531
Hobbs spent a lot of time here.
Spent a lot of time

38
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:46,033
with his daughter here.

39
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:48,202
She would make the ideal bait,
wouldn't she?

40
00:03:48,253 --> 00:03:50,671
Hobbs killed alone.

41
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,774
Ah. Someone else was here.

42
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:05,664

43
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,881
(applause)

44
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,883
Thank you.

45
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,902
Please stop that.

46
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,233
This is how I caught
Garrett Jacob Hobbs.

47
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,737
It's his resignation letter.

48
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,423
Does anybody see the clue?

49
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,428
There isn't one.

50
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:48,096
He wrote a letter,

51
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:52,100
he left a phone number,
no address. That's it.

52
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:55,087
Bad bookkeeping and dumb luck.

53
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,116
(gasping)

54
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,708
Garrett Jacob Hobbs is dead.
The question now is

55
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:20,779
how to stop those
his story is going to inspire.

56
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,499
(projector click)
He's already got one admirer.

57
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,085
A copycat.

58
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,404
Hi.

59
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,489
How are you, Will?

60
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:51,360
Uh, I have no idea.

61
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,362
Um, I didn't want you
to be ambushed.

62
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,146
This is an ambush?

63
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,665
Ambush is later.

64
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,000
Immediately later...
soon to now.

65
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:01,169
When Jack arrives,
consider yourself ambushed.

66
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:03,004
Here's Jack.

67
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,791
- How was class?
- Um, they applauded.

68
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,293
- It was inappropriate.
- Well, the review board would

69
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:11,680
beg to differ. You're up
for a commendation. And they've, uh,

70
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:13,799
okayed active return
to the field.

71
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,467
The question is,

72
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:18,670
do you want to go back
to the field?

73
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,273
I want him back in the field.

74
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,175
And I've told the board
I'm recommending a psych eval.

75
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,195
Are we starting now?

76
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,531
Oh, the session wouldn't be
with me.

77
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:33,184
Hannibal Lecter's a better fit.
Your relationship's not personal.

78
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,204
But if you are more comfortable
with Dr. Bloom...

79
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:39,207
No, I'm not going to be comfortable
with anybody inside my head.

80
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:42,544
You've never killed anyone
before, Will.

81
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:45,029
It's a deadly force encounter.
It's a lot to digest.

82
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,531
I used to work Homicide.

83
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,167
The reason you currently <i>used</i>
to work Homicide is because

84
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:51,920
you didn't have the stomach
for pulling the trigger.

85
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,206
You just pulled the trigger
10 times.

86
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,343
Wait, so a psych eval isn't
a formality?

87
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:01,179
No, it's so I can get some sleep
at night. I asked you

88
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:03,548
to get close to the Hobbs thing.
I need to know you didn't get

89
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,918
too close. How many nights did
you spend in Abigail Hobbs'

90
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,937
hospital room, Will?

91
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:13,775
Therapy doesn't work on me.

92
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,373
Therapy doesn't work on you
because you won't let it.

93
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,583
And because I know

94
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:23,160
all the tricks.

95
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:24,703
Well, perhaps you need
to un-learn some tricks.

96
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,922
Why not have a conversation
with Hannibal?

97
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:29,958
He was there. He knows
what you went through.

98
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,546
Come on, Will.

99
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,248
I need my beauty sleep!

100
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:48,894
What's that?

101
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:53,598
Your psychological evaluation.
You are totally functional and

102
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,067
more or less sane. Well done.

103
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:58,904
Did you just rubber stamp me?

104
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,173
Yes. Jack Crawford may lay his

105
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,325
weary head to rest
knowing he didn't break you

106
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:06,011
and our conversation can proceed
unobstructed by paperwork.

107
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:12,450
Jack thinks
that I need therapy.

108
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:16,922
What you need is a way out of dark
places when Jack sends you there.

109
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,007
Last time he sent me
into a dark place,

110
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,592
I brought something back.

111
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,061
A surrogate daughter?

112
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,184
You saved Abigail Hobbs' life.
You also orphaned her.

113
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,520
That comes with certain
emotional obligations,

114
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,206
- regardless of empathy disorders.
- You were there.

115
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,525
You saved her life too.
Do you feel obligated?

116
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:40,612
Yes.

117
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:44,115
I feel a staggering amount
of obligation.

118
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,134
I feel responsibility.

119
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:51,006
I've fantasized about scenarios
where my actions may have

120
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,225
allowed a different fate
for Abigail Hobbs.

121
00:09:57,914 --> 00:10:01,182
Jack thinks Abigail Hobbs
helped her dad kill those girls.

122
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:06,021
How does that make you feel?

123
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:08,223
How does it make you feel?

124
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,342
- I find it vulgar.
- Me too.

125
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,228
And entirely possible.

126
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,014
- It's not what happened.
- Jack will ask her

127
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,483
when she wakes up, or he'll have
one of us ask her.

128
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:21,236
Is this therapy,
or a support group?

129
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,189
It's whatever you need it
to be.

130
00:10:27,192 --> 00:10:28,994
And, Will,

131
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,147
the mirrors in your mind can
reflect the best of yourself,

132
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:34,299
not the worst of someone else.

133
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,754
(crow cawing)

134
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,090
Jason, where are you
taking us? I think we're lost.

135
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,708
Calm down, man.

136
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,477
I know where we are.

137
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,908
What is that?

138
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,612
I bet it's marijuana.

139
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,065
Mushrooms. Look, they got
tubes to water 'em or something.

140
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,783
No, it's a marijuana plant.

141
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,090
That's not marijuana.

142
00:11:51,292 --> 00:11:53,159
I'm pretty sure

143
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:56,162
firearm accuracy isn't
a prerequisite for teaching.

144
00:11:56,196 --> 00:11:58,248
Well, I've been
in the field before.

145
00:11:58,299 --> 00:11:59,716
Now you're back

146
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,069
- in the saddle. Ish.
- Ish indeed.

147
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:06,222
Took me 10 shots to drop Hobbs.

148
00:12:06,257 --> 00:12:07,950
Zeller wanted to give
you the bullets he

149
00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:09,642
pulled out of Hobbs in
an acrylic case, but

150
00:12:09,677 --> 00:12:11,895
I told him you wouldn't
think it was funny.

151
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:14,847
- Probably not.
- I suggested one of those

152
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:17,183
clackin' swingin' ball things.

153
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:21,688
That would've been funny.

154
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:34,784
You're a Weaver. I took you
for an isosceles guy.

155
00:12:34,835 --> 00:12:37,787
I have a rotator cuff issue so
I have to use the Weaver stance.

156
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:40,123
You are tight.

157
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:42,074
I got stabbed when I was a cop.

158
00:12:42,092 --> 00:12:44,076
Yeah, I got stabbed
in the third grade

159
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:47,513
with a number two pencil. Thought
I was gonna get lead poisoning.

160
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:50,266
Uh, no lead in pencils;
It's graphite.

161
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:53,353
See if that helps
with the recoil.

162
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:05,264
That was better.

163
00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:08,568
You come all the way down here
to teach me how to shoot?

164
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:12,989
No. Jack sent me down here to find
out what you know about gardening.

165
00:13:15,826 --> 00:13:17,877
(crow cawing)

166
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:38,815
So, Lecter gave you
the all-clear.

167
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:41,267
Therapy might work on you
after all.

168
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:45,104
Therapy is an acquired taste
which I have yet to acquire.

169
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:48,775
But, uh, it served your purpose.
I'm back in the field.

170
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:50,493
Local police found

171
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:53,279
tire tracks
on a hidden service road

172
00:13:53,313 --> 00:13:55,832
and some small animal traps
in the surrounding area.

173
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:58,317
He wanted to keep his crop
undisturbed.

174
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:00,503
The only thing missing is
the scarecrow.

175
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:05,968
OK, we've got nine
bodies, various

176
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:07,927
stages of decay, and
as you can see,

177
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:10,279
all very well fertilized.

178
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:13,766
He buried them
in a high-nutrient compost.

179
00:14:13,784 --> 00:14:16,268
He was enthusiastically
encouraging decomposition.

180
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:18,471
They were buried alive with
the intention of keeping them

181
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:20,940
that way... I mean,
for a little while.

182
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,851
(Jimmy): Long enough
for the fungus to eat

183
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:24,744
away any distinguishing
characteristics.

184
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:26,746
Line and rebar were used

185
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,583
to administer intravenous fluids
after they were buried.

186
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:32,969
He was feeding them something.

187
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:37,123
No restraints?

188
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:40,126
- Just dirt.
- The other end of the air-supply system

189
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:41,744
comes up over there.

190
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:44,013
It isn't a very considerate
clean air solution,

191
00:14:44,064 --> 00:14:47,650
which clearly wasn't a priority,
'cause he isn't lazy.

192
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:50,870
No, he's not.

193
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,394
You find any shitakes?

194
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:00,846
(Jimmy): No.

195
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:02,865
Welcome back.

196
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:14,460
Tell Sam to give me a call,
will you? Thank you.

197
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,051
Excuse me.
I'm one of the parents

198
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:24,504
of the explorers
who found the bodies.

199
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:27,006
I wanted to thank you for being
so good with all the boys.

200
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,343
- Those boys were very brave.
- They are good boys. - Yeah.

201
00:15:30,377 --> 00:15:34,063
- You're a local police detective?
- Yes ma'am.

202
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:36,566
Would it be an imposition
to ask a few things?

203
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,085
The boys are gonna
have questions and I

204
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:39,569
just want to be as
honest with them as...

205
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:42,438
- Of course.
- Can you, uh,

206
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:45,208
tell me what that man is doing
over there by himself?

207
00:15:45,242 --> 00:15:47,360
He's some kind
of special consultant.

208
00:15:47,394 --> 00:15:50,079
- Works for the FBI.
- Huh.

209
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:07,746
(sound muted)

210
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:14,103
(soft ambient pulse)

211
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:58,681
(Sound returns.)

212
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:05,771
I do not bind his arms or legs

213
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:09,275
as I bury him
in a shallow grave.

214
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:13,596
(ventilator pumping)

215
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,832
He's alive.

216
00:17:15,866 --> 00:17:18,984
But he will never
be conscious again.

217
00:17:27,177 --> 00:17:29,295
He won't know that he's dying.

218
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:32,998
I don't need him to.

219
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:37,820
This is my design.

220
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:50,666
- I think your family's leaving.
- We drove separately.

221
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:53,986
(muffled gasp) (Will gasping)

222
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:56,455
(Will): I need an EMT!

223
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,043
(person gasping)

224
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:04,163
- (Katz): EMT! We need an EMT!
- (Zeller): Don't touch him!

225
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:14,340
This may have been premature.

226
00:18:16,343 --> 00:18:20,346
What did you see?
Out in the field.

227
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:24,150
Hobbs.

228
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:25,651
An association?

229
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:27,203
A hallucination.

230
00:18:27,237 --> 00:18:30,072
I saw him lying there
in someone else's grave.

231
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:33,142
Did you tell Jack what you saw?

232
00:18:33,176 --> 00:18:35,361
No.

233
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,880
It's stress.

234
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:39,582
Not worth reporting.

235
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:42,835
You displaced the victim
of another killer's crime

236
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:46,005
with what could arguably be
considered your victim.

237
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,374
I don't consider Hobbs
my victim.

238
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:52,028
What do you consider him?

239
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:54,096
Dead.

240
00:18:57,384 --> 00:19:00,519
Is it harder imagining the thrill
somebody else feels killing,

241
00:19:00,553 --> 00:19:03,055
now that you've done it
yourself?

242
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,621
The arms.

243
00:19:18,672 --> 00:19:22,875
Why did he leave them exposed?
To hold their hands?

244
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:25,094
To feel the life
leaving their bodies?

245
00:19:25,128 --> 00:19:27,213
No, that's too
esoteric for someone

246
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:29,298
who took the time
to bury his victims

247
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:31,884
in a straight line.
He's more practical.

248
00:19:31,918 --> 00:19:34,303
- He was cultivating them.
- He was keeping them alive.

249
00:19:34,354 --> 00:19:36,305
He was feeding them
intravenously.

250
00:19:36,356 --> 00:19:39,358
But your farmer let his crops die.
Save for the one that didn't.

251
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:41,427
Well, and the one that didn't
died on the way to the hospital,

252
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:42,921
though they weren't crops;
They were the fertilizer.

253
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:44,397
The bodies were
covered in fungus.

254
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:48,217
The structure of a fungus mirrors
that of the human brain...

255
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:50,720
an intricate web
of connections.

256
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:55,157
So maybe he admires
their ability to connect

257
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,159
the way human minds can't.

258
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,962
Yours can. (Will laughs.)

259
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:02,965
Yep. Um... yeah,
not physically.

260
00:20:04,968 --> 00:20:07,219
Is that what your farmer is
looking for?

261
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:09,455
Some sort of connection?

262
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,793
(Will): Goodbye.

263
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:25,087
- Miss Kimball?
- Yes.

264
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:26,805
Good evening. Please come in.

265
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:41,495
I've,

266
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:44,164
uh, never seen
a psychiatrist before.

267
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:47,751
And I am unfortunately
thorough,

268
00:20:47,802 --> 00:20:52,072
so you're one of three doctors
I'm interviewing.

269
00:20:52,106 --> 00:20:54,424
It's more or less a bake-off.

270
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:56,593
I'm very supportive
of bake-offs.

271
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,711
It's important you find someone
you're comfortable with.

272
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,932
I can imagine you
as my therapist,

273
00:21:01,966 --> 00:21:03,934
which is good.

274
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:06,087
If I can't visualize opening up

275
00:21:06,088 --> 00:21:08,188
emotionally, I know it
would be a problem.

276
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:10,173
May I ask why now?

277
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,559
Do you mind if I ask you

278
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:15,779
a few questions first?
Of course not.

279
00:21:15,813 --> 00:21:19,116
I love that you've written
so much on social exclusion.

280
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:21,735
Since that's why I'm here,
I was wondering...

281
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:23,754
Are you Freddie Lounds?

282
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:31,394
This is unethical,
even for a tabloid journalist.

283
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:33,413
I am, uh,

284
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,599
I am so embarrassed.

285
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:39,970
I'm afraid I must ask
for your bag.

286
00:21:40,004 --> 00:21:42,105
What?

287
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,623
Your bag.

288
00:21:43,658 --> 00:21:47,277
Please hand it over.

289
00:21:47,311 --> 00:21:49,496
I'd rather not take it
from you.

290
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:54,767
Thank you.

291
00:21:57,321 --> 00:21:59,906
I was recording
our conversation.

292
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:02,392
Our conversation?
Yours and mine?

293
00:22:02,426 --> 00:22:04,277
Yes.

294
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:06,329
No other conversation?

295
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:07,864
No.

296
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:12,135
You were very persistent
about your appointment time.

297
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,787
How did you know
when Will Graham would be here?

298
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:17,257
I may have also recorded
your session with Will Graham.

299
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,259
You didn't answer
the question. How did you know?

300
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:22,479
I can't answer that question.

301
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:27,167
Come. Sit by me.

302
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:36,910
Delete the conversations
you recorded.

303
00:22:36,944 --> 00:22:40,113
Doctor-patient confidentiality
works both ways.

304
00:22:42,116 --> 00:22:44,117
Delete it, please.

305
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:55,428
You've been terribly rude,
Miss Lounds.

306
00:22:58,466 --> 00:23:01,218
What's to be done about that?

307
00:23:03,588 --> 00:23:06,773
♪ (J.S. Bach: Cello
Suite No.4: Prelude)

308
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:09,809
Loin, served with a Cumberland
sauce of red fruits.

309
00:23:09,843 --> 00:23:12,229
Um, loin. What kind?

310
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,465
- Pork.
- Wonderful.

311
00:23:15,499 --> 00:23:19,519
I don't get many opportunities
to, uh, eat home-cooked meals.

312
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:23,823
My wife and I both work, and,
uh, as hard as I tried not to,

313
00:23:23,857 --> 00:23:26,576
I did wind up
marrying my mother.

314
00:23:26,627 --> 00:23:29,696
Your mother didn't cook?

315
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:31,882
She did, she did.

316
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,416
I only wish she didn't.

317
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:35,502
There was this meal

318
00:23:35,536 --> 00:23:37,870
she used to prepare. She liked
to call it "oriental noodles".

319
00:23:37,889 --> 00:23:42,259
Spaghetti, soy sauce,
bouillon cubes, and spam.

320
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,895
I was raised thin
as a youngster.

321
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:47,063
Well, next time,
bring your wife.

322
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:50,016
I'd love to have you
both for dinner.

323
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,735
Thank you.

324
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,386
Mmm.

325
00:23:53,404 --> 00:23:56,940
Lovely. So, why do you think
Will Graham

326
00:23:56,991 --> 00:23:58,909
- came back to see you?
- I'm sure

327
00:23:58,943 --> 00:24:01,778
he recognizes the necessity
of his own support structure

328
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:03,780
if he is to go on supporting
you in the field.

329
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:05,782
Well, I believe that a guy
like Will Graham knows

330
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,784
exactly what's going on
inside of his head,

331
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:10,120
which is why he doesn't want
anyone else up there.

332
00:24:10,171 --> 00:24:12,956
Are you not accustomed
to broken ponies in your stable?

333
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,625
You think Will Graham's
a broken pony?

334
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:18,578
I think you think Will is
a broken pony.

335
00:24:18,596 --> 00:24:20,430
Have you ever lost
a pony, Jack?

336
00:24:20,464 --> 00:24:22,933
If you're asking me
whether or not I've ever

337
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:26,102
lost someone in the field,
the answer is yes. Why?

338
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:28,888
I want to understand why
you're so delicate with Will.

339
00:24:28,923 --> 00:24:30,674
Because you don't
trust him, or because

340
00:24:30,675 --> 00:24:32,425
you're afraid of
losing another pony?

341
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:36,279
I've already had my psych eval.

342
00:24:36,314 --> 00:24:39,065
Not by me.

343
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:42,369
You've already told me about your mother.
Why stop there?

344
00:24:46,123 --> 00:24:49,709
(laughing): Oh, great.
All right.

345
00:24:53,947 --> 00:24:55,615
Mm.

346
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:06,760
- What were they soaked in?
- A highly concentrated mixture

347
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:09,262
of hardwoods, shredded
newspaper, and pig poop...

348
00:25:09,296 --> 00:25:11,431
perfect for growing mushrooms
and other fungi.

349
00:25:11,465 --> 00:25:13,433
It was not
the mushrooms, though.

350
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:16,135
They all died of kidney failure.
Dextrose in all the catheters.

351
00:25:16,153 --> 00:25:18,638
He probably used some kind
of dialysis or peristaltic

352
00:25:18,656 --> 00:25:21,107
to pump fluids after their
circulatory systems broke down.

353
00:25:21,141 --> 00:25:23,109
Force-feeding them sugar water?

354
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:26,112
(Jimmy): You know who loves sugar water?
Mushrooms. They crave it.

355
00:25:26,146 --> 00:25:27,881
Recovering alcoholics.
They crave sugar.

356
00:25:27,882 --> 00:25:29,616
Uh, don't take that
personally, buddy.

357
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,202
- Oh, I'm not recovering.
- Feed sugar to the fungus

358
00:25:32,253 --> 00:25:35,064
in your body, the fungus
creates alcohol, so

359
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:37,874
it's like friends helping
friends, really.

360
00:25:37,925 --> 00:25:42,178
It's not just alcoholics who have
compromised endocrine systems.

361
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:44,798
They all died of kidney failure?

362
00:25:44,832 --> 00:25:46,783
Mmhmm.

363
00:25:46,817 --> 00:25:48,835
Death by diabetic ketoacidosis.

364
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:52,138
- Did you know they were diabetics?
- We don't know

365
00:25:52,172 --> 00:25:54,724
they were diabetics.
No, they're all diabetics.

366
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:57,143
He induces a coma
and puts them in the ground.

367
00:25:57,177 --> 00:25:59,679
How is he inducing
diabetic comas?

368
00:25:59,697 --> 00:26:01,681
Changes their medication.
So he's a doctor or a pharmacist

369
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:04,317
or he works somewhere
in medical services.

370
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:06,319
He buries them, feeds them
sugar to keep them alive

371
00:26:06,353 --> 00:26:08,688
long enough for the circulatory
systems to soak it up.

372
00:26:08,706 --> 00:26:12,242
- So he can feed the mushrooms!
- We dug up his mushroom garden.

373
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:14,294
Yeah, he's gonna want
to grow a new one.

374
00:26:24,722 --> 00:26:27,424
I'm picking up a prescription
for Gretchen Speck.

375
00:26:27,475 --> 00:26:29,426
Gretchen Speck... (typing)

376
00:26:29,477 --> 00:26:31,394
- Horowitz.
- Oh, it's just Speck.

377
00:26:31,429 --> 00:26:34,881
We're divorced. I lost
the hyphen, kept the ring.

378
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:37,216
- Insulin.
- Yes.

379
00:26:39,219 --> 00:26:43,055
Oh. Oh, it's
the wrong one. Just...

380
00:26:43,074 --> 00:26:45,608
- Uh-oh.
- No, no, it's OK.

381
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,410
Just gonna be one second.

382
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:54,400
There. There you go.

383
00:26:54,418 --> 00:26:56,953
Oh, could you sign here please?

384
00:27:02,793 --> 00:27:07,046
And that's your correct address?
Yeah.

385
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,432
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

386
00:27:18,101 --> 00:27:19,317
Mrs. James.

387
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:22,961
If you could sign here, please?

388
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:30,602
Thank you.

389
00:27:34,774 --> 00:27:38,343
She's the chain's 10th
diabetic customer to disappear

390
00:27:38,377 --> 00:27:40,445
after filling a prescription
for insulin,

391
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,464
second to disappear
from this exact location.

392
00:27:42,498 --> 00:27:45,283
- And the other eight?
- All over the county. One pharmacist

393
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:47,819
all over the county as well.
Floater, huh?

394
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,822
Floater's floating right here. Still
logged in at his work station.

395
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:58,780
Everyone please stop
what you are doing;

396
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,250
Put your hands in the air!

397
00:28:02,284 --> 00:28:04,586
Special Agent Jack Crawford.
Which one of you is

398
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,087
Eldon Stammets?

399
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:08,089
Eldon was just here.

400
00:28:08,123 --> 00:28:10,959
- Just now.
- Is his car still

401
00:28:10,977 --> 00:28:13,795
in the parking lot?

402
00:28:13,813 --> 00:28:15,814
His car!

403
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,734
Give me your baton.

404
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:31,279
Ugh!

405
00:28:31,313 --> 00:28:34,315
(ventilator pumping)

406
00:28:38,704 --> 00:28:40,672
She's alive!

407
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:43,324
(Jack coughing)

408
00:28:43,342 --> 00:28:44,993
EMTs! Now!

409
00:28:52,051 --> 00:28:54,686
All right. We know his name,

410
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,639
we have his address,
we have his car.

411
00:28:57,673 --> 00:28:59,774
Jack. We just checked
the browser history

412
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:02,027
at Stammets' work station.
Am I gonna wanna hear this?

413
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:06,014
No. And yes, but mostly no.

414
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:12,537
- Freddie Lounds.
- (Jack): TattleCrime.com.

415
00:29:12,572 --> 00:29:16,024
"The FBI isn't just hunting
psychopaths, they're headhunting them

416
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:18,743
"too, offering competitive pay
and benefits in the hopes

417
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:23,748
of using one demented mind..."
Keep going.

418
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:26,484
- (Katz): It's about Will.
- (Jack): Go on.

419
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,837
"One demented mind to catch..."

420
00:29:28,871 --> 00:29:31,590
She goes into a lot of detail.
Son of a bitch.

421
00:29:49,775 --> 00:29:52,277
You are naughty, Miss Lounds.

422
00:29:55,998 --> 00:29:58,116
(knocking on door)

423
00:29:58,167 --> 00:30:01,086
Who is it?

424
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,204
(knocking on door)

425
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:06,291
Who is it?

426
00:30:09,078 --> 00:30:11,630
Ah!

427
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:22,140
(Zeller): All clear.

428
00:30:24,593 --> 00:30:27,312
I appreciate the pageantry,
Agent Crawford,

429
00:30:27,363 --> 00:30:29,731
but you can't arrest me
for writing an article.

430
00:30:29,765 --> 00:30:31,900
You entered a federal crime
scene without permission.

431
00:30:31,934 --> 00:30:34,936
- Escorted by a detective.
- Under false pretence!

432
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,938
It is as good as permission.

433
00:30:36,956 --> 00:30:39,407
You lied to a police officer.

434
00:30:39,441 --> 00:30:42,627
You can't arrest me for lying.

435
00:30:46,782 --> 00:30:49,501
You got all that information
from a local detective?

436
00:30:53,506 --> 00:30:55,640
Lots of talk
about your man Graham.

437
00:30:55,675 --> 00:30:58,677
Not to mention the rivalry
of who gets the collar.

438
00:30:58,711 --> 00:31:01,846
A local police detective
looking for a pissing contest

439
00:31:01,897 --> 00:31:03,848
with the FBI might have
some insight.

440
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:06,151
- And evidently did.
- Sure did.

441
00:31:06,185 --> 00:31:09,137
You know, the unfortunate
timing of your article allowed

442
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:11,156
a murderer to escape.

443
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,278
You were in Minnesota.

444
00:31:17,313 --> 00:31:20,481
You were in the Shrike's nest.
You know how I know?

445
00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:22,867
'Cause you left one
of these hairs behind.

446
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:24,869
You contaminated
the crime scene.

447
00:31:24,904 --> 00:31:27,205
Just like everywhere you go,
you contaminate crime scenes.

448
00:31:27,256 --> 00:31:30,041
That's obstructing justice.
I can indict you

449
00:31:30,092 --> 00:31:32,844
for obstructing justice.

450
00:31:32,878 --> 00:31:36,347
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't.

451
00:31:36,382 --> 00:31:38,516
You don't write another word
about Will Graham

452
00:31:38,551 --> 00:31:40,501
and I won't have to.

453
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:52,947
(Zeller): You used me.

454
00:31:55,284 --> 00:31:58,937
(monitor beeping)
(ventilator pumping)

455
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,101
(footsteps)

456
00:33:00,316 --> 00:33:02,618
"He and the Grandmother
discussed better times."

457
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:04,919
The old lady said that

458
00:33:04,954 --> 00:33:07,789
"in her opinion,
Europe was entirely

459
00:33:07,823 --> 00:33:09,941
to blame for the way things were
now. She said..."

460
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:11,476
What are you reading?

461
00:33:16,832 --> 00:33:19,433
Flannery O'Connor.

462
00:33:19,451 --> 00:33:21,870
When I was Abigail's age,

463
00:33:21,904 --> 00:33:23,955
I was obsessed. I even tried
to raise peacocks

464
00:33:23,989 --> 00:33:26,741
because she raised peacocks.

465
00:33:26,775 --> 00:33:29,661
But... they were
really stupid birds.

466
00:33:31,664 --> 00:33:33,715
You could be reading
to a killer.

467
00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:38,436
Innocent until guilty
and all that.

468
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,672
I'm about to broach the subject

469
00:33:40,723 --> 00:33:45,593
of that "Takes One
to Know One" article.

470
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:48,263
Oh, that.

471
00:33:48,297 --> 00:33:50,265
Did Jack send you?

472
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:53,535
No, I sent me.

473
00:33:55,604 --> 00:34:00,258
I don't think we've ever been alone
in a room together, have we?

474
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:03,261
I haven't noticed. Have we?

475
00:34:03,295 --> 00:34:07,148
Not that we're
necessarily alone now.

476
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:09,751
Yeah, right. Back to...

477
00:34:09,785 --> 00:34:13,838
"Jack Crawford's crime gimp".
It certainly creates an image.

478
00:34:13,873 --> 00:34:16,124
I don't need to talk about it

479
00:34:16,158 --> 00:34:18,676
if you don't.
No, no, we can talk about

480
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:22,213
or not talk about
whatever you want.

481
00:34:25,684 --> 00:34:27,668
Actually, I was...

482
00:34:27,686 --> 00:34:30,671
I was just enjoying
listening to you read.

483
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:37,061
Abigail Hobbs is a success
for you.

484
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:45,486
She doesn't look
like a success.

485
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,706
Don't feel sorry for yourself

486
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:52,026
because you saved this girl's life.
I don't.

487
00:34:52,044 --> 00:34:55,880
I don't feel sorry for myself
at all.

488
00:34:55,915 --> 00:34:59,067
I feel, um...

489
00:34:59,101 --> 00:35:01,052
I-I...

490
00:35:01,086 --> 00:35:02,754
I feel, um...

491
00:35:06,442 --> 00:35:08,259
good.

492
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,735
Don't know where you got
half that information.

493
00:35:49,736 --> 00:35:51,219
It wasn't from me.

494
00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:53,604
I may have made
some inferences.

495
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:56,307
They think I told you
all of it.

496
00:35:56,358 --> 00:35:58,309
They saw you talking to me.

497
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,646
They think it's my fault
Stammets escaped.

498
00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:04,148
- I'm sorry I got you fired.
- I wasn't fired.

499
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:06,951
I was suspended.
They're gonna fire you.

500
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:09,120
Jack Crawford will make sure
of that.

501
00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:10,905
You...

502
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:14,275
you stir the hornet's nest,
and I'm the one who gets stung?

503
00:36:14,293 --> 00:36:17,745
I can help you get work outside
the force, if you want me to.

504
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:20,715
I know people
in private security.

505
00:36:22,718 --> 00:36:25,253
Not the first cop
you got fired.

506
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:27,588
Guarantee you it pays better.
Right now,

507
00:36:27,622 --> 00:36:29,974
future you is thanking me.

508
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:34,962
I read your article.

509
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,982
Tell me about Will Graham.

510
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:53,327
(Lounds): Hey, Jack.

511
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,946
Miss Lounds?

512
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,950
Go ahead and stand down, officer.
Miss Lounds, are you all right?

513
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,752
Where's Will Graham?

514
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,754
We have an eyewitness
to the murder.

515
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,789
We don't need Will Graham.
No, that's not why I'm asking.

516
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:09,927
Someone find me Will Graham!

517
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,646
This is about Will?
He was talking about people

518
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,649
having the same properties of a fungus.
Stammets?

519
00:37:15,683 --> 00:37:19,135
Thoughts leaping from brain to brain.
They mutate, they evolve.

520
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,573
Well, what does he
want with Will Graham?

521
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:23,991
Someone who understands him.

522
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:26,977
Graham was right. Stammets is
looking for connections.

523
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:28,662
What did you tell him?

524
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,315
I need to know

525
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,786
what you told Eldon Stammets
about Will Graham.

526
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,788
I told him
about the Hobbs girl.

527
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,023
What did you tell him?

528
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,476
Everything.

529
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,712
He wants to help Will Graham
connect with Abigail Hobbs.

530
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,131
He's gonna bury her.

531
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:49,833
(ding!)

532
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,852
Sorry.

533
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,208
(ding!)

534
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:17,794
(phone ringing)

535
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,796
- Hello?
- [lt's Jack.]

536
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:21,798
[Are you at the hospital?]
Yes, I am.

537
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:24,835
[Stammets knows
about Abigail Hobbs.]

538
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:47,324
Where is she? Abigail Hobbs,
the girl in 408. Where is she?

539
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,443
- They took her for tests.
- Who took her?

540
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:52,062
Who took her?!

541
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,911
Hey!

542
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:12,799
(grunting in pain)

543
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,115
What were you gonna do to her?

544
00:39:28,149 --> 00:39:30,784
We all evolved from mycelium.

545
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:32,803
I'm simply reintroducing her
to the concept.

546
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,755
By burying her alive?

547
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,157
The journalist said
you understood me.

548
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,992
I don't.

549
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,712
Well, you would have.

550
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,214
You would have.

551
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,383
If you walk through a field
of mycelium,

552
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,635
they know you are there.
They know you are there.

553
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:53,223
<i>The spores reach for you</i>
<i>as you walk by.</i>

554
00:39:55,677 --> 00:39:58,595
I know who you're reaching for.
I know.

555
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,181
Abigail Hobbs.

556
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,567
And you should have let me
plant her.

557
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:06,236
You would have found her
in a field,

558
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,072
where she was finally able
to reach back!

559
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:15,996
(Lecter):<i>When you shot</i>
<i>Eldon Stammets,</i>

560
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:17,998
<i>who was it that you saw?</i>

561
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:22,002
I didn't see Hobbs.

562
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:25,172
Then it's not Hobbs' ghost
that's haunting you, is it?

563
00:40:25,206 --> 00:40:28,008
It's the inevitability

564
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:32,012
of there being a man so bad
that killing him felt good.

565
00:40:32,046 --> 00:40:34,164
Killing Hobbs felt just.

566
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,501
Which is why you're here...

567
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,871
to prove that sprig of zest
you feel is

568
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,206
from saving Abigail,
not from killing her dad.

569
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:47,711
I didn't feel a sprig of zest
when I shot Eldon Stammets.

570
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,063
You didn't kill Eldon Stammets.

571
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:57,704
I thought about it.

572
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:00,707
I'm still not entirely sure
that wasn't my intention

573
00:41:00,742 --> 00:41:02,876
pulling the trigger.

574
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,062
If your intention was
to kill him,

575
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:08,382
it's because you understand
why he did the things he did.

576
00:41:08,416 --> 00:41:12,502
It's beautiful in its own way...

577
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:16,239
giving voice
to the unmentionable.

578
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:20,010
I should've stuck to fixing
boat motors in Louisiana.

579
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:25,015
A boat engine is a machine, a
predictable problem, easy to solve.

580
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:28,185
You fail, there's a paddle. Where
was your paddle with Hobbs?

581
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:32,388
- You're supposed to be my paddle.
- I am.

582
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:37,043
It wasn't the act of killing
Hobbs that got you down, was it?

583
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:43,467
Did you really feel so bad because
killing him felt so good?

584
00:41:45,453 --> 00:41:47,570
I liked killing Hobbs.

585
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,694
Killing must feel good
to God too...

586
00:41:54,729 --> 00:41:57,214
he does it all the time.

587
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,800
And are we not created
in his image?

588
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:03,370
That depends who you ask.

589
00:42:03,404 --> 00:42:05,889
God's terrific.

590
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,725
He dropped a church roof
on 34 of his worshippers

591
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:11,945
last Wednesday night in Texas,
while they sang a hymn.

592
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:14,748
And did God feel good
about that?

593
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,468
He felt powerful.

594
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:25,535
