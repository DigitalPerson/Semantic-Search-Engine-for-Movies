1
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,156
Remember when they use to let
commercial airlines land in this town?
-Yeah

2
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,390
Well, I don't understand where 
we're going...

3
00:00:57,712 --> 00:00:59,550
...or why the hell we're bothering 
anyhow.

4
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,632
-You're doing a good deed.
-Wanna give us a better reason.

5
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:06,959
Yeah. A maniac hijacked a municipal bus
with 30 passengers on it. 
That's a pretty good reason.

6
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,737
And I got a real bad hunch where 
those passengers are
and who that maniac is.

7
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:12,210
You wanna share it with us.

8
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:13,785
Phoenix.

9
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:15,802
Simon Phoenix.

10
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:53,310
Send a maniac to catch one.

11
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,610
Phoenix!

12
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,900
Don't move, Phoenix.

13
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,479
You're under arrest.

14
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,079
Arrest? Shit.

15
00:03:15,649 --> 00:03:16,998
And you're trespassing.

16
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:19,633
Where are the passengers?

17
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:21,644
Oh, yes, the passengers.

18
00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:23,319
Well, they're....

19
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,579
Fuck you.

20
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,437
The passengers are gone.

21
00:03:28,192 --> 00:03:31,457
See, I told the city, I said
"Look, nobody comes down here."

22
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,478
Postmen figured it out...

23
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:35,153
...policemen figured it out.

24
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,670
But the goddamn bus drivers
just wouldn't listen.

25
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,718
Last time, Phoenix.

26
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:43,224
Where are the hostages?

27
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:46,411
To hell with the hostages!.
This is between you and me!.

28
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:52,232
What you got? Soldier boy.

29
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:52,970
Do something.

30
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,458
Go ahead.

31
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:57,494
You're up to your ass in gasoline.

32
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,437
I'll set your ass on fire.

33
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,553
Is it cold in here...

34
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:18,759
...or is it just me?

35
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:51,079
Where are they, Phoenix?

36
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,832
Now, where did I put them?

37
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:56,610
I swear, I'd lose my head
if it wasn't attached.

38
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,431
I'll keep that in mind.

39
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:42,702
Damn it, I'm tired
of this "demolition-man" shit!

40
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,991
You were not supposed
to come down here!

41
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:48,177
You were not supposed to attempt
the arrest of Phoenix single handedly

42
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,288
...And you were not suppose to 
blow anything up!

43
00:05:50,363 --> 00:05:53,436
It's not me this time Healy! He 
dumped the gas
and rigged the place to blow!

44
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:55,031
Yeah right, you had nothing 
to do with this.

45
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:57,597
I know you've tried
to nail this psycho for two years.

46
00:05:57,762 --> 00:05:59,314
But try remembering a little thing called...

47
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:01,312
...official police procedure?

48
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,277
-Where are the hostages?
-They're not here.

49
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:04,369
What do you mean their 
not here?

50
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,951
He must've stashed them 
someplace else!

51
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:08,106
Now how do you know they weren't 
in there.Are you sure?

52
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:11,473
I did a thermo check and there were eight
of them, all part of his gang.

53
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:12,471
Wrong again!

54
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,595
You got something to say?
Scumbag!

55
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,719
Get him out of here!

56
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:18,584
Motherfucker!

57
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,908
You and I are gonna have a
nice long chat

58
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:21,744
Captain!

59
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,835
Over here! There're bodies everywhere!

60
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:27,439
There must be 20 or 30.

61
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:28,547
They're everywhere.

62
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,993
See that Captain? I told him!

63
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,762
He said he didn't care!

64
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:37,635
How could you sacrifice
all those innocent people for me!

65
00:06:37,871 --> 00:06:39,718
What kind of man are you?

66
00:06:39,752 --> 00:06:42,822
We'll spend a lot of quality time together.
'See ya, sweetie!

67
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,059
Honey! Sugar!

68
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:47,870
If you got a lawyer, better call him.

69
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:45,997
John Spartan, you've done great deeds
for the city of Los Angeles.

70
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,022
So, it is with some regret that l,
William Smithers...

71
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:52,430
...acting as Assistant Warden,
hereby carry out this sentence.

72
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:53,673
Skip it.

73
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:57,749
Sergeant Spartan,you've been 
sentenced to 70 years...

74
00:07:57,765 --> 00:08:01,502
...sub-zero re-habilitation
in the California Cryo-Penitentiary...

75
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,241
...for the involuntary manslaughter
of 30 innocent civilians.

76
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:06,062
Skip it.

77
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:09,556
You'll be placed in cryo-stasis
for the duration of your sentence...

78
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,030
...during which your behavior 
will be altered
through synaptic suggestion.

79
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:17,162
You'll be eligible for parole
no earlier than the year 2046.

80
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,588
I'm sorry sergeant

81
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,674
All personnel...

82
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,230
...the next scheduled parole hearing
for prisoner Gilmour...

83
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,099
...will take place at 07:15.

84
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:33,887
Warden William Smithers
report to Level A, conference room.

85
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,448
Mellow greetings. Warden William
Smithers

86
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:43,998
Be well, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

87
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:46,588
As it is a beautiful...

88
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:50,372
...Monday morning and as my duty log
irrationally requires it...

89
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:52,800
...I'm hereby querying you
on the 
prison population update.

90
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:54,552
Does the tedium continue?

91
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:57,483
Your earnest questioning is as 
amusing as it is irrelevant.

92
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,692
The prisoners are ice cubes.
They never move.

93
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:03,598
I find this lack of stimulus
to be truly disappointing.

94
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:05,584
-Don't you think?
-I try not to.

95
00:12:05,764 --> 00:12:07,670
However, you're young, 
think all you want.

96
00:12:08,073 --> 00:12:10,752
Things don't happen anymore,
we've taken care of all that.

97
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:13,559
I'll fiber-op you back 
after the 
morning parole hearings.

98
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:15,153
Have a peachy day Lieutenant!

99
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,309
Be well.

100
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:17,487
Be well.

101
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,976
Vector 137.

102
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,519
Upcoming, Santa Monica Boulevard.

103
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:28,110
Retina coding accepted.

104
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,614
Warden William Smithers, 
be well.

105
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:31,356
Go on.

106
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:40,440
Self-drive on.

107
00:12:40,638 --> 00:12:42,288
Self-drive engaged.

108
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,759
Huxley Lenina Coding on.

109
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:47,635
No police presence is requested
in the city at this time.

110
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:48,985
Report to the station.

111
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:51,550
Oh, boy, how exciting.

112
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:25,909
That's it.

113
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:28,132
"Food, glorious food. "

114
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,267
There'll be another in 12 hours.

115
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:32,315
These assholes are nothing if 
not predictable.

116
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:34,405
God, I love to hate this place!

117
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:35,890
There's not enough of us, Friendly.

118
00:13:36,036 --> 00:13:38,019
That doesn't really matter anymore.

119
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:39,239
People are hungry.

120
00:13:39,471 --> 00:13:41,467
We've got nothing left to lose.

121
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:56,121
Greetings Erwin

122
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:57,661
Lovely Lenina.

123
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:03,499
Greetings and salutations, welcome
to the emergency line of 
the San Angeles Police Department.

124
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:06,278
If you prefer an automated response,
press one now.

125
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,668
Be well lieutenant

126
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:12,831
Mellow greetings, Lenina Huxley.

127
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:14,831
Let me guess, all is serene?

128
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:17,713
On the contrary, it's been 
a horrific a.m.

129
00:14:18,353 --> 00:14:20,448
There was a defacement of 
Public buildings.

130
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:22,157
Walls smudged with...

131
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:24,320
...scandalous graffiti.

132
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:25,315
Really?

133
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:28,792
Brutal. Why wasn't there
an "all-cars notify"?

134
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,876
Because there was no need
to create widespread panic.

135
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:34,592
Lieutenant Huxley...

136
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:37,918
...I monitored your disheartening
and distressing comments...

137
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:38,948
...to the warden this morning.

138
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:42,518
Do you really long for chaos
and disharmony?

139
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:47,363
Your fascination with the vulgar 20th 
century is seems to be 
affecting your better judgment.

140
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:51,634
You realize you're setting a 
bad example for other 
officers and sworn personnel.

141
00:14:52,148 --> 00:14:54,280
Thank you for the attitude readjustment
Chief Earle.

142
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,078
Info assimilated.

143
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:05,257
Sanctimonious asshole.

144
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,880
Lenina Huxley, you are fined 1/2 credit...

145
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,534
...for a 'sotto voce' violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

146
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:12,133
Thank you.

147
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,354
That was tense.

148
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:22,450
-That was tense?
-Yes.

149
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:28,352
Tell me Garcia, don't you get 
bored code tracing perps who 
break curfew and tell dirty jokes?

150
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:30,791
Actually, no. I find my job 
deeply fulfilling.

151
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:35,377
I just cannot get over the reality
of this office, Leninas Huxley.

152
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:37,915
You're still addicted to the 20th century.

153
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:41,151
High from its harshness.
Buzzed by its brutality.

154
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:43,168
Holy smokes!

155
00:15:43,804 --> 00:15:47,633
I mean is there anything in this 
office which doesn't violate 
Contraband Ordinance 22?

156
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:49,786
Only you, Alfredo Garcia.

157
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:52,949
Don't you ever want something 
to happen?

158
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,348
Goodness, no.

159
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,792
I knew you were gonna say that.

160
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:02,590

Let's get this one over quick.

166
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:32,475
Twenty-nine years ago,
the parole system, as you know it...

167
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,391
...was rendered obsolete.

Federal Statute 537-29....

169

Stop it!

170
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,673
Do you have anything fresh to say
on your behalf?

171
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:56,474
I thought not.

172
00:16:59,279 --> 00:16:59,996
Yeah.

173
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:01,315

00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:23,913
I wish I knew.

177
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:25,592

I knew him.

229
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:10,553
He's evil in a way you've 
never read about.

-Of course not.
-You don't get it, Lenina Huxey.

236

Phoenix isn't coded.

237
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:32,257

Tell me L-7, is the doctor's conveyance 
still in the parking zone?

253
00:21:12,477 --> 00:21:15,520
The answer is no. Car missing.

254
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:19,727
Doctor's conveyance is not
in parking zone. It is in motion.

255
00:21:22,474 --> 00:21:24,716

don't feel like there's 
anything special about me.

271
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:26,322
You are an incredibly sensitive

324
00:25:32,535 --> 00:25:33,513
Lucky number seven.

325
00:25:50,378 --> 00:25:51,697
We're police officers!

326
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:54,158
We're not trained to handle this kind
of violence!

327
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:02,961
Hey! Wait for me!

328
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,229
Stupid.

329
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:42,570
Simon says: everybody sing!

330
00:26:43,524 --> 00:26:45,352
"And the home

331
00:26:45,415 --> 00:26:48,895
"Of the brave "

332
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,493
Play ball!

333
00:26:58,265 --> 00:27:00,029
We've lost every camera for six blocks.

334
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,315
Go to Century City, 1200 millimeters.

335
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,588
He's going for the vehicle's battery coil.

336
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,210
It's pure capacitance gel.

337
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,216
The problem is not the defacement
of public buildings or...

338
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:33,006
...the noise pollution caused
by the exploding devices.

339
00:27:33,607 --> 00:27:35,165
Allow me to explain.

340
00:27:35,797 --> 00:27:38,765
The real problem lies
in the man whose initials...

341
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,051
...mark the detonating graffiti...

342
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:43,469
...on the streets of our peaceful city.

343
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,681
The man behind the "E.F."...

344
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,079
...Mr. Edgar Friendly.

345
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:53,055
For a sadly extended period of time...

346
00:27:53,613 --> 00:27:55,136
...we in San Angeles...

347
00:27:55,326 --> 00:27:58,964
...have been plagued by a pack
of subterranean hooligans.

348
00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:01,909
You will come to know them as "scraps."

349
00:28:02,665 --> 00:28:06,218
Men and women who have left the comfort
of our society...

350
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:08,017
...only to spew hostility...

351
00:28:08,175 --> 00:28:10,518
...at the very bosom
they have relinquished.

352
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:14,050
There was a time when we used
to look upon these scraps...

353
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,318
...as rather pathetic
and relatively harmless.

354
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:19,752
Now they have a leader.

355
00:28:20,763 --> 00:28:23,216
Mr. Friendly seems relentless
in his ambition...

356
00:28:23,505 --> 00:28:26,258
...to infect our harmony with 
his venom.

357
00:28:26,814 --> 00:28:28,072
He must, of course...

358
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:30,115
...be stopped.

359
00:28:30,872 --> 00:28:33,964
This radical terrorist behavior,
led by Mr. Friendly...

360
00:28:34,186 --> 00:28:36,939
...must not be allowed
to undermine our safety.

361
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:40,645
"Safety Above All."

362
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:44,450
I expect your trust,
confidence and certitude.

363
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,865
If you'll excuse me.

364
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:51,088
Dr. Cocteau...

365
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,720
...a cryo-con has effected self-release
from the penitentiary.

366
00:28:55,304 --> 00:28:59,824
It's quite horrific. MurderDeathKills,
all categories of chaos.

367
00:28:59,813 --> 00:29:02,159
Enhance your calm.
Enhance your...

368
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,792
"Be well" them for me.

369
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,193
Get me Captain George Earle 
immediately.

370
00:29:16,687 --> 00:29:17,673
It was just....

371
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,793
I mean it was so....

372
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,639
How can a man be so blatantly sadistic?

373
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,935
It was fun for him.

374
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,234
I want you to do everything 
in your power
to snare this agent of destruction.

375
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,391
You have my utmost confidence.

376
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,477
It will be done, Dr. Cocteau.

377
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,915
Be well.

378
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,312
"Utmost confidence."

379
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,431
"Everything in our power."

380
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,713
What else is there?

381
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:55,479
Zachary Lamb...

382
00:29:56,493 --> 00:29:59,982
...how was the fiendish Simon Phoenix
apprehended back in the 20th?

383
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:02,277
Twelve-state manhunt.

384
00:30:03,143 --> 00:30:04,453
Satellite surveillance.

385
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:07,588
A video bite on Unsolved Mysteries.

386
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:10,408
None of them worked.

387
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,796
In the end, it took just one man.

388
00:30:13,496 --> 00:30:14,420
One cop.

389
00:30:15,616 --> 00:30:16,576
John Spartan.

390
00:30:17,614 --> 00:30:18,779
John Spartan?

391
00:30:18,835 --> 00:30:19,727
That's right.

392
00:30:20,272 --> 00:30:22,189
They called him the "Demolition Man."

393
00:30:23,138 --> 00:30:26,701
Spartan file 98345, LAPD.

394
00:30:27,877 --> 00:30:31,804
Spartan file 98761C, LAPD.

395
00:30:34,197 --> 00:30:36,230
Are you sure this is real life?

396
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,594
Barely.

397
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,068
Spartan's a legend.

398
00:30:39,602 --> 00:30:43,760
I've been doing a historical study.
Over 1,000 arrests over three years.

399
00:30:43,898 --> 00:30:45,276
All authentic criminals.

400
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,795
There was a lot more business 
back then.

401
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:51,127
How can you justify destroying 
a $7 million mini mall...

402
00:30:51,132 --> 00:30:53,761
...to rescue a girl
whose ransom is only $25,000?

403
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,534
Fuck you, lady.

404
00:30:55,637 --> 00:30:56,911
Good answer.

405
00:30:57,745 --> 00:30:59,554
This is your recommendation?

406
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,070
The Demolition Man's an animal.

407
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:06,632
He's clearly the man for a job such as this.
You could reinstate him.

408
00:31:07,582 --> 00:31:09,573
He's a muscle-bound grotesque...

409
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,549
...who hasn't worn a shield in 40 years.

410
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,518
Simon Phoenix is an old-fashioned 
criminal.

411
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,511
We need an old-fashioned cop.

412
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,356
Cryo-flex 312 and 618 is ready
for routine 
maintenance and inspection.

413
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:06,634
John Spartan, 5864.

414
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,680
Pulmonary activity approaching normal.

415
00:32:09,724 --> 00:32:13,142
Body temperature, 63% and rising.

416
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,432
Biolink engaged.

417
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,621
Laser defibrillation sequence started.

418
00:32:20,094 --> 00:32:22,324
Plasma transfer in 15 seconds.

419
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,649
Plasma transfer, 10 seconds...

420
00:32:26,924 --> 00:32:27,969
...8 seconds...

421
00:32:28,258 --> 00:32:29,914
...6 seconds....

422
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,431
Plasma transfer complete.

423
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,317
MTL complete.

424
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,150
Hunting down an escaped cryo-con...

425
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,311
...by releasing another one?

426
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,233
I am unconvinced.

427
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,709
This is within the powers of 
the police charter, sir.

428
00:33:05,056 --> 00:33:08,475
He can be released on limited parole
and reinstated to active duty.

429
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,525
It's not enough to collect the '90s...
You have 
to bring them back to life

430
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,539
Dr. Cocteau said everything within 
our power.

431
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,433
I can't think of a better idea.

432
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,590
That still doesn't mean it's 
a good one.

433
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,555
This man comes from a dissimilar method
of law enforcement.

434
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,837
I'm not sure he's any different
than Simon Phoenix himself.

435
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,989
Detective?

436
00:33:29,236 --> 00:33:32,603
Detective...I am Lieutenant Lenina 
Huxley.

437
00:33:32,768 --> 00:33:34,521
The year is 2032.

438
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,667
Now, the reason you have been 
released is--

439
00:33:37,665 --> 00:33:39,417
How long have I been under?

440
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,193
Thirty-six years.

441
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,673
I had a wife.

442
00:33:48,282 --> 00:33:50,079
What happened to my wife?

443
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,850
Her light was extinguished
in the Big One of 2010.

444
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,714
She died.

445
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,318
In an earthquake.

446
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,353
The earthquake.

447
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,273
I had a daughter.

448
00:34:10,769 --> 00:34:12,615
I made a promise. What happened 
to her?

449
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,736
John Spartan.

450
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:15,879
I am Chief of Police George Earle.

451
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:18,541
We didn't thaw you out
for a family reunion.

452
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,113
Consider it fortunate the lieutenant 
even bothered 
to do a probe on your wife.

453
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,154
This is about you and the cryo-con 
Simon Phoenix.

454
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,046
What?

455
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:31,758
This morning Simon Phoenix 
escaped from this cryo-facility. 
We've had 11 murderDeathKills...

456
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,795
...so far.

457
00:34:33,934 --> 00:34:37,495
You see, we've become a society
of peace-loving...

458
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,667
...and understanding and we are,
quite frankly, not equipped...

459
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:41,855
...to deal with this situation.

460
00:34:41,906 --> 00:34:45,740
There have been no deaths of unnatural 
causes in 
San Angeles in the last 16 years.

461
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,115
Where?

462
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,398
The Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, 
San Diego Metroplex 
were merged in 2011.

463
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,556
You are in the center of what 
used to be Los Angeles.

464
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,314
That's great.

465
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,371
-You, get me a Marlboro.
-Yes, of course. Right away.

466
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,274
What's a Marlboro?

467
00:35:03,555 --> 00:35:05,430
It's a cigarette. Any cigarette.

468
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,207
Smoking is not good for you. And it 
has been deemed that 
anything not good for you is bad.

469
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,989
Hence, illegal. Alcohol, caffeine,
contact sports, meat--

470
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,553
Are you shitting me?

471
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,361
John Spartan, You are fined 
one credit for violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

472
00:35:22,095 --> 00:35:23,671
What the hell is that?

473
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,954
- John Spartan. You are fined one credit....
-Bad language...

474
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:29,993
...chocolate, gasoline, uneducational toys
and anything spicy.

475
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,554
Abortion is also illegal, but then 
again so is pregnancy
if you don't have a license.

476
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,639
Caveman...

477
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,158
...Iet's finish with all the Rip Van Winkle
and get moving.

478
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,049
Our Mr. Phoenix has risen 
from the ashes.

479
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,870
I tracked that dirtbag for two years...

480
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,714
...and when I finally bring him down
you turn me into an 
ice cube for my trouble.

481
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,633
Thanks, but no thanks.

482
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,156
The conditions of your parole
are full reinstatement into the SAPD...

483
00:35:54,147 --> 00:35:57,516
...and immediate assignment to the 
apprehension of Simon Phoenix.

484
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,635
Or...

485
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,869
...you can go back into cryo-stasis.

486
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,998
Not many people get a second chance,
John Spartan.

487
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,750
Any new inforama on Simon Phoenix?

488
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,229
There is nothing, Lenina Huxley.

489
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:21,645
Where's your John Spartan?

490
00:36:21,673 --> 00:36:25,156
Oh. He went to the bathroom.
I guess he got all thawed out.

491
00:36:28,732 --> 00:36:31,819
Sir, I formally convey my presence.

492
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:34,794
How are you doing?

493
00:36:35,178 --> 00:36:37,738
We're not used
to physical-contact greetings.

494
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,595
Sorry. I don't know...

495
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,530
...if you guys know it but...

496
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:44,124
...you're ah...You're out of 
toilet paper.

497
00:36:45,762 --> 00:36:47,792
Did you say "toilet paper"?

498
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,687
They used handfuls of wadded paper...

499
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,432
...back in the 20th.

500
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,048
I'm happy you're happy, but the place 
where your 
supposed to have toilet paper...

501
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,840
...you've got this little shelf with 
three seashells on it.

502
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,760
He doesn't know how to use 
the three seashells.

503
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,945
I can see how that can be confusing.

504
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,511
I don't believe it. Is that you, Spartan?

505
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,599
Zach Lamb?

506
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:24,273
What happened to you?

507
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,879
I got older.

508
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:30,102
My God, I remember when 
you were...

509
00:37:30,095 --> 00:37:31,768
...a snot noose rookie pilot.

510
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,548
They finally grounded me.

511
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,999
Shit, you were a damn good flyer.

512
00:37:37,058 --> 00:37:40,758
You're fined two credits for violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

513
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:42,798
I'll be right back.

514
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:45,395
They seem to be friends, yet...

515
00:37:45,403 --> 00:37:47,109
...he speaks to him
in the most profane manner.

516
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:52,024
Well, if you had read my study, 
you would know that this is how 
insecure heterosexual males use to bond.

517
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:53,334
I knew that.

518
00:37:54,116 --> 00:37:59,444
Thanks a lot you shit-brained, fuck-faced, 
ball-breaking, duck-fucking...

519
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,154
-...pain in the ass.
- You're fined five credits...

520
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,879
...for repeated violations
of the verbal-morality statute.

521
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,712
So much for the seashells.

522
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:08,111
See you in a few minutes.

523
00:38:12,798 --> 00:38:14,648
Voice check, Lenina Huxley.

524
00:38:14,687 --> 00:38:17,097
Unfortunately Simon Phoenix
was not coded.

525
00:38:17,306 --> 00:38:20,096
While you were sleeping, everyone in 
the city was installed code.

526
00:38:20,152 --> 00:38:24,252
It was a brilliant idea by Dr. Cocteau
that an organically 
bio-engineered microchip...

527
00:38:24,265 --> 00:38:25,306
...is sewn into the skin.

528
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:28,581
Sensors all over the city
can zero in on anyone at any time.

529
00:38:28,722 --> 00:38:32,513
I can't even conceive a visual 
of what you police 
officers did before it was developed.

530
00:38:32,595 --> 00:38:35,149
We worked for a living. This fascist crap
makes me want to puke.

531
00:38:35,674 --> 00:38:37,501
What do you think you're scratching,
Caveman?

532
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:40,599
You really think we'd let you go
without control?

533
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,409
Your code was implanted
the second you thawed.

534
00:38:43,646 --> 00:38:45,621
Why don't you just shove a leash 
up my ass?

535
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:47,741
You dirty meat-eater!

536
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:50,733
No matter how Viking your era was...

537
00:38:50,837 --> 00:38:53,795
...I cannot digest how
you ever wore a badge!

538
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:56,606
You're going back, John Spartan,
Oh yes, you're going back!

539
00:38:56,694 --> 00:38:59,346
Could you two please
dump some hormones?

540
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:01,721
We need every cortex we can get 
in this situation.

541
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,151
We don't need the Neanderthal.

542
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:06,552
Our computer has already examined
every feasible scenario...

543
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:08,474
...resulting from the appearance
of Simon Phoenix.

544
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:12,872
It is determined he will attempt to 
set up a new drug lab 
and form a crime syndicate.

545
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,500
That is correct. Chief George
Earle

546
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:17,262
Look, I hate to interrupt you two
love birds...

547
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:19,293
...but that's really fucking stupid.

548
00:39:19,309 --> 00:39:20,955
You think he wants to start a business?

549
00:39:21,516 --> 00:39:23,347
Phoenix is going for a gun.

550
00:39:23,511 --> 00:39:24,944
Plain and simple.

551
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:26,194
Trust me.

552
00:39:26,763 --> 00:39:28,189
He's going for a gun.

553
00:39:28,304 --> 00:39:30,035
Who cares what this primate thinks?

554
00:39:30,717 --> 00:39:32,331
Resonate some understanding.

555
00:39:32,654 --> 00:39:35,370
The only place a person
can even view a gun in this city...

556
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,794
...is at a museum.

557
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:47,089
Welcome to the San Angeles Museum
of History.

558
00:39:48,046 --> 00:39:50,143
Beneath you, you will see 
an excavation...

559
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,034
...of an actual 20th-century street scene...

560
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:58,144
...in downtown Los Angeles,
preserved since the earthquake of 2010.

561
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,391
For specific information
on objects featured in the exhibit....

562
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,244
Firearms are displayed in the Armory...

563
00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:07,409
...Iocated on Level A.

564
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,232
You are now entering the 
Hall of Violence...

565
00:40:12,603 --> 00:40:15,709
...a visual representation
of the primitive behavior prevalent...

566
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,189
...during the late 20th century.

567
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,478
Home, sweet home.

568
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:28,154
John Spartan, even if Simon Phoenix
was able to 
locate the cache of firearms...

569
00:40:28,148 --> 00:40:30,697
...it would be impossible for him 
to remove them.

570
00:40:30,768 --> 00:40:34,189
She's right. They're located
in a maximum-security armory exhibit.

571
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,589
It's just a hunch. So trust me 
on this.

572
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:37,994
It's a cop thing.

573
00:40:38,162 --> 00:40:39,801
And what am l, a frog?

574
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:43,496
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

575
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:45,691
-I'll drive.
-I see.

576
00:40:49,186 --> 00:40:51,861
Resetting all bio-links for new driver.

577
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,969
Weight, height, peripheral vision set.

578
00:40:55,544 --> 00:40:56,283
If you would like...

579
00:40:56,277 --> 00:41:00,834
...to commence transportation,
John Spartan, initialize sequence now.

580
00:41:01,352 --> 00:41:02,461
You drive.

581
00:41:07,642 --> 00:41:10,135
Welcome, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

582
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,392
You seem very much alone,
John Spartan, but...

583
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,710
...things aren't all that different.

584
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,109
Perhaps you'd like to hear
an oldies station?

585
00:41:28,328 --> 00:41:30,784
"Oh, what a relief it is. "

586
00:41:30,777 --> 00:41:32,847
This is the most popular station 
in town.

587
00:41:33,146 --> 00:41:35,706
Wall-to-wall mini-tunes.
You called them "commercials."

588
00:41:35,728 --> 00:41:37,798
Here's that classic you've all 
been waiting for.

589
00:41:37,888 --> 00:41:41,374
The number one request of the day:
"Armour Hot Dogs. "

590
00:41:41,372 --> 00:41:43,130
"Kids eat Armour Hot Dogs.... "

591
00:41:43,141 --> 00:41:44,466
Wow, this is my fave!

592
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:47,139
"Fat kids, Skinny kids, kids 
who climb on rocks

593
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:50,220
"Tall kids, sissy kids, even kids with...

594
00:41:50,222 --> 00:41:52,164
"...chicken pox love hot dogs

595
00:41:52,192 --> 00:41:54,159
"Armour Hot Dogs

596
00:41:54,348 --> 00:42:01,253
"The dogs kids love to bite. "

597
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,354
Somebody put me back in the fridge.

598
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:09,954
You are entering the armory exhibit.

599
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:13,900
You will find displays in the cabinets 
and the walls around you...

600
00:42:13,913 --> 00:42:16,222
So sorry. Didn't see you there.

601
00:42:18,341 --> 00:42:19,830
Sweet baby.

602
00:42:21,825 --> 00:42:22,948
Oh, shit.

603
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,991
Now, this is what I'm talking 
about.

604
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,993
How do I get in here?

605
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,188
Do you gotta wait that 15-day 
waiting period?
Or can I just like take one now?

606
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,313
Motherfucker.

607
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,399
Oh, fuck it.

608
00:42:51,054 --> 00:42:52,153
Mellow greetings.

609
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,272
What seems to be your boggle?

610
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,679
My "boggle"?

611
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,638
How much do you weigh?

612
00:43:03,005 --> 00:43:04,189
Well, I happen to weigh--

613
00:43:11,663 --> 00:43:14,259
Please vacate the museum, patrons.

614
00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:15,696
Be calm.

615
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,419
Please vacate...

616
00:43:17,436 --> 00:43:20,307
...the museum, patrons. Be calm.

617
00:43:20,616 --> 00:43:22,554
Wait a minute, this is the future.

618
00:43:23,085 --> 00:43:24,636
Where are all the phaser guns?

619
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:31,437
Mellow greetings, sir.

620
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,872
What's your boggle?

621
00:43:39,749 --> 00:43:42,014
Warning, please exit rapidly.

622
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,435
The magnetic accelerator gun,
the last 
produced hand-held weapon...

623
00:43:45,437 --> 00:43:48,347
...of this millennium,
displaced the flow of neutrons...

624
00:43:48,343 --> 00:43:51,779
...through a nonlinear cycloid
electromagnetic accumulator.

625
00:43:52,138 --> 00:43:53,856
So, what? It needs batteries?

626
00:43:53,973 --> 00:43:57,010
What size? I mean where the fuck
do you find batteries in the future?

627
00:43:57,005 --> 00:43:58,895
Is there a battery store around 
mother fucker?

628
00:43:59,115 --> 00:44:00,774
Excuse me, museum patron. 
Can l--

629
00:44:02,803 --> 00:44:04,710
What? Where's the Radio Shack?

630
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:12,457
Sweet music to my ears.

631
00:44:12,466 --> 00:44:16,680
When activated, the magnetic 
accelerator gun
will achieve fusion in 2.6 minutes.

632
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,554
Yeah, well, I was thinking about 
leaving quickly.
Patience is not one of my virtues.

633
00:44:33,064 --> 00:44:33,999
Did you see that?

634
00:44:34,543 --> 00:44:35,035
What?

635
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:38,271
Never mind. I give up trying
to figure this place out.

636
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,469
Excuse me, Rambo. I need to 
borrow this.

637
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,516
Access and correlate procedure.

638
00:44:49,005 --> 00:44:51,314
Establish communication with 
maniac intruder.

639
00:44:51,317 --> 00:44:52,386
Wrong.

640
00:44:52,406 --> 00:44:55,321
-Hey, Luke Skywalker, use the Force.
-Oh, dear.

641
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,485
-Hey, what the hell is this?
-It's a glow-rod. It's what we got.

642
00:44:58,538 --> 00:44:59,452
Does it work?

643
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,674
Guess so.

644
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,558
They have him trapped in 
Section 8.

645
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,756
I doubt it Huxley. Now make sure 
that building's clear.

646
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,239
Done. I want a visual.

647
00:45:10,401 --> 00:45:14,386
Now! Every corridor in the museum,
I want full sensors routed to 
me and I want it 90 seconds ago.

648
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,908
You guys wait here. Give me 
10 minutes.

649
00:45:19,778 --> 00:45:24,464
Patron, you are now confined 
to the armory.

650
00:45:26,273 --> 00:45:30,931
Museum patron, you are now confined
to the Armory.

651
00:45:35,053 --> 00:45:37,628
The armory exhibit is now sealed.

652
00:45:38,253 --> 00:45:42,871
All museum patrons still occupying 
the facility
should remain calm.

653
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,878
Help is imminent.

654
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,909
This museum is no longer sealed.
Is it?

655
00:45:52,073 --> 00:45:54,511
What can I say? I'm a blast from the past.

656
00:45:54,653 --> 00:45:56,405
You should've stayed there.

657
00:45:56,444 --> 00:45:58,878
That voice sounds familiar. Who is that?

658
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,078
Bad aim, Blondie.

659
00:46:04,077 --> 00:46:05,978
Spartan? John Spartan?

660
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,415
Oh shit.They let anybody into 
this century!
What the hell are you doing here?

661
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,239
Simon says:. bleed!

662
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:18,433
Great. Just great.

663
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:20,756
You're making it too easy for
me, Phoenix!

664
00:46:20,841 --> 00:46:22,911
Come on, you piece of shit!

665
00:46:23,704 --> 00:46:24,873
So let me get this right.

666
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:28,471
They defrosted you just so you 
could lasso my piddly ass?

667
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:32,882
I've been dreaming about killing 
you for 40 years.

668
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:36,719
Keep dreaming!

669
00:47:33,857 --> 00:47:35,987
AK Mag now reactivated.

670
00:47:35,995 --> 00:47:37,189
It's about time.

671
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:38,517
The past is over, John!

672
00:47:38,613 --> 00:47:40,251
Time for something new and 
improved!

673
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:41,653
Oh, hell.

674
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,272
Holy Shit! I love this gun!

675
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,498
How do you like me in the future,
John huh?

676
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:08,945
Come on! Come on!

677
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,668
Ooh! I know that must have 
hurt!

678
00:48:17,706 --> 00:48:19,344
Huh, Soldier Boy?

679
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:21,851
You're on TV!

680
00:48:29,733 --> 00:48:30,943
You're dead, Spartan!

681
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:32,998
Forgot to say:. "Simon says."

682
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,469
Oh, shit.

683
00:48:38,954 --> 00:48:39,834
Good one.

684
00:48:42,872 --> 00:48:45,277
It's a brave new world! 
Sorry, you gotta go!

685
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,404
Shit!

686
00:49:15,412 --> 00:49:18,190
Our noble facility has been desecrated
by hooligans.

687
00:49:19,646 --> 00:49:21,629
Someone will pay dearly for this.

688
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,319
Sir, the stress breeder is inside
being demobilized as we speak.

689
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:35,045
Shit. My being frozen must've thrown
my aim off.

690
00:49:35,368 --> 00:49:37,677
Don't worry. I'll get you with 
the next shot.

691
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:40,433
I don't think so.

692
00:49:42,293 --> 00:49:45,625
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

693
00:49:46,405 --> 00:49:48,446
And you were doing so well.

694
00:49:49,123 --> 00:49:50,950
Now, don't you have a job 
to do?

695
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,764
Isn't there a thought repeating
in that barbaric brain of yours?

696
00:49:56,296 --> 00:49:57,632
The name Friendly.

697
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,811
Mr. Edgar Friendly.

698
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,275
Don't you have someone to kill?

699
00:50:10,085 --> 00:50:12,790
-Yeah, I do.
-Excellent.

700
00:50:13,556 --> 00:50:15,071
Then go and do your job.

701
00:50:15,542 --> 00:50:16,724
Phoenix!

702
00:50:17,822 --> 00:50:20,538
Shit. Saved by the bell.

703
00:50:26,585 --> 00:50:27,355
Shit!

704
00:50:36,489 --> 00:50:37,315
Damn!

705
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:41,985
You don't know how lucky you 
are that maniac didn't whack you.

706
00:50:42,371 --> 00:50:46,815
Well, I must say that "whacking," 
whatever it is,
sounds most disagreeable.

707
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,828
Well, you scared him away.

708
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,479
I don't know how to thank you.
You saved my life.

709
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:52,913
No problem.

710
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,678
Not bad for a 74-year-old.

711
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,873
Simon Phoenix knows
he has some competition.

712
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,150
He's finally matched his meat.

713
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,316
You really licked his ass.

714
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,701
That's "met his match"...

715
00:51:08,704 --> 00:51:10,660
...and "kicked his ass."

716
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,268
"Met his match and kicked his ass."

717
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,553
Captain Earle....

718
00:51:16,498 --> 00:51:18,090
Who is this man?

719
00:51:18,606 --> 00:51:22,876
Detective John Spartan, temporarily 
reinstated to the San 
Angeles Police Department...

720
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:25,588
...to pursue the escaped cryo-con
Simon Phoenix.

721
00:51:26,846 --> 00:51:29,671
You told us to do everything in our 
power to capture the mad man.

722
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,518
Oh,Yes...Yes, I did. I did.

723
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,135
Yes, I do recall the exploits
of Mr. John Spartan.

724
00:51:36,236 --> 00:51:39,297
Didn't they call him? Yes, of course. 
The Demolition Man.

725
00:51:39,491 --> 00:51:41,255
It's quite all right, Chief.

726
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:43,131
Unexpected. Creative.

727
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,239
But quite all right.

728
00:51:45,692 --> 00:51:48,097
John Spartan, welcome.

729
00:51:48,497 --> 00:51:50,696
Now, in honor of your arrival 
and your...

730
00:51:50,703 --> 00:51:53,012
...protection of the sanctity of human life...

731
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,788
...namely my own...

732
00:51:54,863 --> 00:51:57,457
...I would like to invite you to join me
to dinner tonight.

733
00:51:57,462 --> 00:51:58,577
The both of you.

734
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:00,200
Please, I insist.

735
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,014
I would like you to accompany me...

736
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,792
...to Pizza Hut.

737
00:52:07,302 --> 00:52:08,991
Look forward to it. Thank You.

738
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,279
"Pizza Hut?"

739
00:52:19,997 --> 00:52:21,397
So let me get this right:

740
00:52:21,926 --> 00:52:25,158
Spacely Sprockets here, who's now
the man in charge, the Mayor-Gov...

741
00:52:25,163 --> 00:52:27,472
...who wants to take me to dinner 
at Pizza Hut...

742
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,398
...though lord knows I wouldn't
 mind a pizza...

743
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,855
...is also one of the guys who built 
the God damn cryo-prison?

744
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,867
John Spartan, you are fined....

745
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:37,066
Dr. Cocteau is the most important man
in San Angeles

746
00:52:37,345 --> 00:52:39,939
He practically created our whole way
of life...

747
00:52:39,978 --> 00:52:40,634
...savage.

748
00:52:40,665 --> 00:52:42,708
Yeah. Well, he can have it.

749
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:45,230
Now, Phoenix could be anywhere...

750
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,438
...but not being coded could hurt him
and limit his options.

751
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:49,343
That is correct. Money is outmoded.

752
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:51,345
All transactions are through codes.

753
00:52:51,382 --> 00:52:54,021
Alright, so he can't buy food
or a place to stay for the night.

754
00:52:54,195 --> 00:52:56,755
It'd be a waste of time to 
mug someone.

755
00:52:57,535 --> 00:52:59,881
Unless he rips off someone's hand. 
And let's hope 
he doesn't figure that one out.

756
00:52:59,935 --> 00:53:02,904
But with all officers already
 patrolling in a 
city-wide crisis net...

757
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:04,712
...it should be just a matter of tick-
tocks before we  actually--

758
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:08,138
More importantly, we already 
have a backup plan.

759
00:53:09,073 --> 00:53:11,069
We can just wait for another code 
to go red.

760
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,425
And when Phoenix performs
another MurderDeathKill...

761
00:53:14,812 --> 00:53:17,079
...we'll know exactly where to pounce.

762
00:53:18,001 --> 00:53:18,831
Great plan.

763
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,264
Thank you.

764
00:53:25,608 --> 00:53:28,875
I've been an enthusiast of your escapades
for quite some time now.

765
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:33,620
I have, in fact, perused some news 
reels from the Schwarzenegger 
Library. And the time you took that car...

766
00:53:33,636 --> 00:53:34,671
Hold it.

767
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,183
"The Schwarzenegger Library?"

768
00:53:37,311 --> 00:53:39,984
Yes, the Schwarzenegger
Presidential Library.

769
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,522
Wasn't he an actor when you--?

770
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:43,415
-Stop. He was President?
-Yes.

771
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:48,390
Even though he was not born in this 
country, his popularity at the time 
caused the 61st Amendment, which states--.

772
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:49,717
I don't want to know.

773
00:53:52,121 --> 00:53:53,039
President?

774
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,584
What the hell is this? What, no door? 
No welcome mat?

775
00:54:06,786 --> 00:54:08,289
What is this?

776
00:54:10,812 --> 00:54:13,548
How do they expect you to kill somebody
around here?

777
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,368
Shit, I love that smell. Reminds 
me of biscuits and gravy.

778
00:54:19,807 --> 00:54:21,877
All right. A job is a job.

779
00:54:23,675 --> 00:54:27,238
Edgar Friendly, whoever the fuck you are,
prepare for Simon Phoenix.

780
00:54:30,703 --> 00:54:32,494
What's with this Cocteau guy
anyway?

781
00:54:32,741 --> 00:54:35,356
He says I saved his life,
which I'm not even sure I did.

782
00:54:35,396 --> 00:54:38,241
And, my reward is dinner and dancing
at Pizza Hut? I mean...

783
00:54:38,256 --> 00:54:41,009
Hey, I like a big, fat piece of pizza, 
but com on...

784
00:54:41,715 --> 00:54:43,706
Your tone is quasi-facetious. But...

785
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,492
You do not realize that Pizza Hut was
the only restaurant
to survive the Franchise Wars.

786
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:48,645
So?

787
00:54:48,978 --> 00:54:51,350
So...Now all restaurants are 
Pizza Hut.

788
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:54,487
No way.

789
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:05,077
Welcome to Pizza Hut.

790
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,238
Enjoy your meal, sir.

791
00:55:09,215 --> 00:55:12,263
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant

792
00:55:13,923 --> 00:55:16,073
"Good things from the garden

793
00:55:16,613 --> 00:55:18,410
"Garden in the valley

794
00:55:19,001 --> 00:55:22,023
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant"

795
00:55:23,557 --> 00:55:26,274
Oh, here comes the Neanderthal.

796
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:29,412
Ah, Mr. Spartan over there please,
and Lieutenant....

797
00:55:29,748 --> 00:55:30,291
Thank you.

798
00:55:34,026 --> 00:55:35,228
How you guys doing?

799
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,591
Enjoy-joy your meal, sir.

800
00:55:40,678 --> 00:55:41,704
Good thing I'm hungry.

801
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,295
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to 
ask you to raise
your glasses to the hero of the hour...

802
00:55:46,856 --> 00:55:47,953
...my savior...

803
00:55:48,452 --> 00:55:50,116
...Detective John Spartan.

804
00:55:52,576 --> 00:55:53,895
Appreciate it.

805
00:55:57,121 --> 00:55:58,793
Greetings and salutations.

806
00:55:58,983 --> 00:56:00,496
I'm Associate Bob.

807
00:56:00,641 --> 00:56:04,586
We met before, ever so briefly.
I was gorveling in fear at the time.

808
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,637
You got the salt over there, Bob?

809
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,681
Um, salt is not good for you, 
hence, it is illegal.

810
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,591
So, John Spartan, tell me...

811
00:56:13,633 --> 00:56:16,884
...what do you think of San Angeles, 2032?

812
00:56:17,323 --> 00:56:21,326
Well, considering the way things were 
going when I went in, I thought 
the future would be a rotting cesspool.

813
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,997
Well, you weren't here when 
the real disturbances began.

814
00:56:25,532 --> 00:56:27,640
Civilization tried to destroy itself.

815
00:56:28,422 --> 00:56:31,092
The city degenerated into a 
total fear zone.

816
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:35,993
The citizenry cocooning in their 
homes, afraid to go out.
People just wanted the madness over.

817
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,519
So, when I saw the chance
to make things right...

818
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,079
...I seized it.

819
00:56:42,948 --> 00:56:46,354
If I had not, the radiance of San 
Angeles would not be here.

820
00:56:47,097 --> 00:56:51,276
Just your rotting cesspool of hate
and suffering. Which would you prefer?

821
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:55,075
Maybe, you can book me a flight out of here
when the sermon's over?

822
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,514
John Spartan...

823
00:56:57,073 --> 00:56:59,797
...for your crimes you would
surely have died...

824
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,233
...in jail before now.

825
00:57:01,749 --> 00:57:05,957
Even you must appreciate the 
persuasively tranquil humanity...

826
00:57:06,033 --> 00:57:07,835
...of the cryo-prison system?

827
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:13,381
I don't want to spoil your dinner 
pal, but my cryo-
sentence was no sweet lullaby.

828
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,396
I had feelings and I had thoughts.

829
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:19,195
How about a 36-year nightmare
about people 
caught in a burning building?

830
00:57:19,619 --> 00:57:21,676
You were awake? I don't think so.

831
00:57:21,715 --> 00:57:23,068
I do think so.

832
00:57:23,611 --> 00:57:27,111
And my wife beating her 
fists against a block
of ice that used to be her husband.

833
00:57:27,417 --> 00:57:31,391
Then you were nice enough to wake me 
up and let me know everything 
that meant something in my life is gone.

834
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,839
It would have been more humane
to stake me down and 
leave me to the fucking crows.

835
00:57:37,378 --> 00:57:40,370
What would you say if I called 
you a brutish fossil...

836
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:43,768
...symbolic of the decayed era
gratefully forgotten?

837
00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:46,787
I don't know. "Thanks?"

838
00:57:47,393 --> 00:57:49,463
I, I thought during rehabilitation...

839
00:57:49,541 --> 00:57:53,375
...the prisoners were not conscious.
A person would go insane.

840
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,574
The side-effects of the cryo-process...

841
00:57:55,652 --> 00:57:56,971
...are unavoidable.

842
00:57:57,087 --> 00:57:58,615
You were found guilty of criminal
charges.

843
00:57:58,622 --> 00:58:00,613
You owed and still do owe a 
debt to society.

844
00:58:01,108 --> 00:58:02,302
I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.

845
00:58:02,435 --> 00:58:04,807
Yeah there is, call for backup.
I'll be across the street.

846
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,727
John Spartan. Where are 
you going?

847
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,641
Bad guys about to do bad things.
It's just one 
of those hunches again.

848
00:58:09,718 --> 00:58:10,433
Oh...

849
00:58:30,062 --> 00:58:31,177
Go for the truck!

850
00:58:31,297 --> 00:58:32,877
The food's in the truck!

851
00:58:35,698 --> 00:58:37,654
Grab the big box! Come on, Move! 
Move! Move!

852
00:58:49,076 --> 00:58:51,956
You're gonna regret this the rest 
of your life. Both seconds of it.

853
00:58:57,012 --> 00:58:58,115
Good night!

854
00:59:07,926 --> 00:59:08,748
Get him!

855
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:28,553
What a fucking hero. Come on.

856
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,519
Please, don't.

857
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:45,851
What the hell?

858
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:48,032
Such reckless abandonment.

859
00:59:48,423 --> 00:59:50,511
Looks like there is a new 
shepherd in town.

860
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,145
That's "sheriff." Who were 
those guys?

861
00:59:53,183 --> 00:59:55,139
They're known as "scraps."

862
00:59:55,475 --> 00:59:57,942
Outcasts and deserters who choose
to live beneath us...

863
00:59:57,941 --> 00:59:59,988
...in sewers and abandoned tunnels.

864
01:00:01,563 --> 01:00:04,698
They're a constant irritation
to our harmony.

865
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:06,668
They're nothing but thugs
and hooligans

866
01:00:06,821 --> 01:00:10,814
A society of thieves. The last remaining
criminal element in the city.

867
01:00:11,014 --> 01:00:14,071
But plans are in progress to 
purge this peril from our day.

868
01:00:14,797 --> 01:00:16,977
You are even better live than 
on laser disk.

869
01:00:17,049 --> 01:00:20,299
And the joy-joy way you paused 
to make a glib 
witticism before doing battle...

870
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:22,408
...with that strangely wasteland 
Scrap with a round house--

871
01:00:22,408 --> 01:00:24,319
Huxley. Look, this isn't the 
Wild West, okay?

872
01:00:24,594 --> 01:00:26,856
The Wild West wasn't even 
the Wild West.

873
01:00:26,871 --> 01:00:28,623
Hurting people is not a 
good thing.

874
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:30,256
Sometimes it is, but not...

875
01:00:30,266 --> 01:00:32,496
...when it's a bunch of people 
looking for something to eat.

876
01:00:41,207 --> 01:00:44,227
San Angeles time is now 22:15.

877
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,837
Huxley, coding off.

878
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:46,999
Auto-drive.

879
01:00:47,195 --> 01:00:48,913
Auto-drive engaged.

880
01:00:54,125 --> 01:00:56,279
Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you
back there.

881
01:00:58,001 --> 01:01:00,231
No need to make a de-hurtful 
retraction.

882
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,990
I just assimilated too much 
contraband.

883
01:01:03,253 --> 01:01:07,212
I fleshed you out as some blow-up-
the-bad-guy-with-
a-happy-grin-he-man type.

884
01:01:07,325 --> 01:01:12,445
But now I realize that you're the moody-
troubled-past-gunslinger-
who-will-only-draw-when-he-must type.

885
01:01:12,442 --> 01:01:13,343
Huxley, Stop.

886
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:14,036
What?

887
01:01:14,306 --> 01:01:16,700
I'm not any of that. I just do my 
job and things get--

888
01:01:16,708 --> 01:01:17,823
Demolished.

889
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:28,230
You know, I keep looking around 
and I think about my 
daughter growing up in a place like this.

890
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:31,327
And I'm afraid she's gonna think I'm some kind of primitive.

891
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:34,232
I mean, as much as I want to see her,
I almost don't want to.

892
01:01:34,643 --> 01:01:36,834
Because I don't think I'm going to 
fit into the picture very well.

893
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,760
Not very well at all.

894
01:01:41,056 --> 01:01:44,553
It would be a minor misuse of 
police powers,
but I could do a search for you.

895
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,498
-No.

896
01:01:50,488 --> 01:01:51,269
Sorry.

897
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,509
Oh, subject change. I got 
what you wanted.

898
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,196
Oh, great.

899
01:02:03,072 --> 01:02:04,391
What do you need that for?

900
01:02:05,629 --> 01:02:07,734
It's just one of those cop 
hunches again.

901
01:02:16,814 --> 01:02:17,594
Lights.

902
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:20,752
Naw. I've changed that.

903
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,913
Illuminate.

904
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:25,922
Deluminate.

905
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,313
Isn't that nicer?

906
01:02:30,845 --> 01:02:32,055
Go ahead, you try it.

907
01:02:33,574 --> 01:02:35,090
Illuminate.

908
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:40,509
Raymond, Raymond, we've got to talk.

909
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,078
How did you get in?

910
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,293
Wish I knew. I got pass codes.

911
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,008
Routes to secret underground 
kingdoms.

912
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:50,565
Complete access to the industrial 
data-grid interface.

913
01:02:50,886 --> 01:02:52,830
I don't even know what that 
shit means.

914
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:55,948
But I've been meaning to ask you 
about it, because I like it!

915
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,393
I like it a lot!

916
01:02:59,566 --> 01:03:01,549
Your skills were given to you
for a reason.

917
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,949
Not for your personal amusement.

918
01:03:04,577 --> 01:03:09,376
Your job is to kill Mr. Edgar Friendly
and stop a 
revolution before it precipitates

919
01:03:09,377 --> 01:03:11,602
That is why you were rehabilitated.

920
01:03:14,811 --> 01:03:18,369
All right. I'm going to do your 
little dastardly deed for you.

921
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:21,560
But it's gonna be a little bit more 
difficult than you thought.

922
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,790
And, I'm going to need some help.

923
01:03:24,548 --> 01:03:28,192
I'll need about five
or six more "special" men.

924
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:31,265
And, I just so happen to have a list.

925
01:03:31,406 --> 01:03:35,176
You see, I wouldn't want you to 
defrost any of those mad-dog 
killer types, you know what I mean?

926
01:03:35,196 --> 01:03:38,711
And none of them motherfuckers
from New York. They're too uptight.

927
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:41,896
So you're going to be the only 
mad-dog killer type, right?

928
01:03:42,544 --> 01:03:44,544
Exactamundo.

929
01:03:46,006 --> 01:03:46,835
Fine.

930
01:03:47,695 --> 01:03:49,014
Take care of it.

931
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,953
Just get it over with.

932
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:54,555
You're beginning to be more 
trouble than you're worth.

933
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,422
Oh, Raymond, don't say that.

934
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,114
And what do I get out of all this?

935
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,993
What do you want?

936
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:06,740
Malibu.

937
01:04:07,829 --> 01:04:11,737
Santa Monica. Hell, what about 
all the coastal cities?

938
01:04:12,429 --> 01:04:14,183
Well. I'll bear it in mind.

939
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,078
-Good, I'll send you a memo.
-Just do your job!

940
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:24,148
What is John Spartan doing here?

941
01:04:25,804 --> 01:04:27,990
Did you invite him to this little 
party of ours?

942
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:31,471
Look, you finish your business...

943
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,630
...and I'll stuff him back in the freezer.

944
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:35,870
Think of him as a guarantee.

945
01:04:36,468 --> 01:04:37,867
"A guarantee?"

946
01:04:38,524 --> 01:04:40,520
Well, you don't have much 
of a guarantee.

947
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,231
I took care of Spartan once,
I'll take care of him again.

948
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,709
Now we need those men defrosted.

949
01:04:54,397 --> 01:04:55,989
So, this is where you live, Huxley?

950
01:04:56,204 --> 01:04:57,557
Very not bad.

951
01:04:57,712 --> 01:04:58,781
Thank you.

952
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,071
So, where will I be staying?

953
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:04,471
Oh, I've procured you a domicile right
down the corridor from my own.

954
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:11,116
Everything is voice coded,
so if you need something, just ask.

955
01:05:11,133 --> 01:05:12,248
Lights.

956
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,719
What do you think?

957
01:05:16,086 --> 01:05:19,530
Clicked off a lot of credits to create
the perfect 20th-century apartment.

958
01:05:19,576 --> 01:05:20,850
Well, Huxley, it's very....

959
01:05:20,992 --> 01:05:22,027
Isn't it?

960
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,873
John Spartan....

961
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,696
There is of course a well-known, 
and documented...

962
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,228
...connection between sex and violence.

963
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,788
Not so much a causal effect...

964
01:05:35,796 --> 01:05:39,171
...but a general state
of neurological arousal.

965
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,709
And...

966
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,863
...after having observed your 
behavior this evening and...

967
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:48,293
...my resultant condition...

968
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,478
...I was wondering if you would 
like to have sex?

969
01:05:58,965 --> 01:05:59,635
With you?

970
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,076
Here?

971
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,155
Now?

972
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,676
Oh, yeah.

973
01:06:09,759 --> 01:06:10,669
Great!

974
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,433
I'll be right back.

975
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,559
Love Boat?

976
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,554
There you go.

977
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,423
Now, just relax. We'll begin 
in a few seconds.

978
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,354
Begin what?

979
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:05,831
Having sex, of course.

980
01:08:02,089 --> 01:08:03,716
Whats wrong? You broke contact.

981
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:06,074
"Contact?" I didn't even touch you yet.

982
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,310
But, I thought you wanted 
to make love.

983
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,153
Is that what you call this?

984
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:17,353
Vir-sex has been proven to produce higher 
orders of alpha waves during 
digitize transference of sexual energies.

985
01:08:17,347 --> 01:08:19,886
All right, Huxley, What do you say 
we just do it the old-fashioned way.

986
01:08:20,015 --> 01:08:21,569
Ugh! Disgusting!

987
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,035
You mean...

988
01:08:24,045 --> 01:08:28,959
-...fluid transfer?
-No, I mean boning, the wild mambo,
the hunka chunka...

989
01:08:28,973 --> 01:08:30,611
That is no longer done.

990
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,366
-The exchange of bodily fluids--do 
you know what that leads to?
-Yeah, I do.

991
01:08:34,423 --> 01:08:36,907
Kids, smoking, a desire to 
raid the fridge.

992
01:08:37,004 --> 01:08:41,520
The rampant exchange of bodily fluids
was one of the major 
reasons for the downfall of society.

993
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,028
After AlDS, there was NRS.
After NRS there was UBT.

994
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,528
In one of the first things that Dr. Cocteau 
was able to do was to outlaw...

995
01:08:48,603 --> 01:08:52,437
...and behaviorally engineer all fluid transfer
out of socially acceptable behavior.

996
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:55,472
Not even...not even mouth 
transfer's condoned.

997
01:08:55,514 --> 01:08:56,867
Kissing's not allowed?

998
01:08:57,012 --> 01:08:58,538
I was a good kisser.

999
01:09:00,032 --> 01:09:01,606
Alright, then what about kids?

1000
01:09:01,845 --> 01:09:03,211
-Procreation?
-Yeah.

1001
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,753
We go to a lab.

1002
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,187
Fluids are purified, screened...

1003
01:09:07,191 --> 01:09:10,342
...and transferred by authorized
medical personnel only.

1004
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:12,157
It is the only legal way.

1005
01:09:15,201 --> 01:09:16,600
What're you doing?

1006
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:18,913
Breaking the law.

1007
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,237
You are a savage creature, John
Spartan.

1008
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,954
And I wish you to leave my 
domicile. Now!

1009
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,114
You know....

1010
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,785
Code accepted. Be well, John Spartan.

1011
01:10:05,172 --> 01:10:06,274
Lights.

1012
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,073
"He doesn't know how to use 
the three seashells."

1013
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,232
Happy Halloween.

1014
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,431
"Behavioral engineering?"

1015
01:11:07,543 --> 01:11:11,544
Hi, Martin. You know, I was thinking....
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, wrong number.

1016
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,432
Our noble facility has been desecrated
by hooligans.

1017
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,595
Someone will pay dearly for this.

1018
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,430
Sir, the stress breeder
is inside being demobilized.

1019
01:11:37,216 --> 01:11:40,872
Shit! Being frozen must've thrown
my aim off. Don't worry.

1020
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,393
The next shot.

1021
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,118
I don't think so.

1022
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,830
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

1023
01:11:58,395 --> 01:12:01,430
-Detective
-Listen I'm sorry about last night.

1024
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,753
Here, I made this for you.

1025
01:12:08,898 --> 01:12:10,783
-For me?
-Yeah.

1026
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,274
Thank you.

1027
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:17,595
Oh, I'll drive.

1028
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,920
-I got to learn to do this once in my life.
-Okay.

1029
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,352
Thank you for the lovely gift.

1030
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:41,438
Look, I don't know what you guys put into my 
cryo-sludge but when I thawed 
out, the first thing I wanted to do was knit.

1031
01:12:41,628 --> 01:12:45,999
I mean...How come I know what a 
zipperfoot, and a shuttle and 
a hook and bobbin and a petty point is?

1032
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,878
I could weave a throw rug right now
with my eyes closed.

1033
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,231
It's part of your rehab program.

1034
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,566
For each inmate the computer draws 
up a skill or trade, which best...

1035
01:12:54,556 --> 01:12:56,306
...suits their genetic disposition.

1036
01:12:56,314 --> 01:12:57,640
And it would implant the knowledge...

1037
01:12:57,650 --> 01:13:00,690
...and the desire to carry out whatever
training was assigned.

1038
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,673
I'm a seamstress?

1039
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:05,394
Oh, that's just great.

1040
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,401
I come out of cryo-prison
and I'm Betsy-fucking-Ross.

1041
01:13:08,508 --> 01:13:11,086
And Phoenix comes out and 
he can access 
computers, operate all vehicles...

1042
01:13:11,076 --> 01:13:13,129
...knows the location of every 
dam thing in town...

1043
01:13:13,146 --> 01:13:15,255
...and is three times stronger than 
when he went in?

1044
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:20,707
-Can you get me Phoenix's rehab 
program now?
-Sure.

1045
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,638
-I'm a seamstress.
-Access code for Simon Phoenix.

1046
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,996
Access Simon Phoenix.

1047
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,388
Accessing.

1048
01:13:30,146 --> 01:13:31,340
Access denied.

1049
01:13:32,992 --> 01:13:34,564
-What?
-Security override.

1050
01:13:34,593 --> 01:13:36,072
This can't be right.

1051
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,795
Access granted, Officer Huxley.

1052
01:13:43,207 --> 01:13:46,829
Accessing Simon Phoenix,
Deepfile rehab 65-R.

1053
01:13:46,932 --> 01:13:48,081
Urban Combatkill.

1054
01:13:48,218 --> 01:13:50,786
Torture Methodology.
Computer Override Authority.

1055
01:13:50,857 --> 01:13:52,173
-There must be a mistake.
-Survival Tactics.

1056
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:55,736
Terrorism Tactics. Weapons Training.
Martial Arts. MurderDeathKill.

1057
01:13:55,788 --> 01:13:57,857
Explosives Technician. Violent Behavior.

1058
01:13:57,902 --> 01:14:00,934
-This isn't a proper rehabilitation program.
-No kidding.

1059
01:14:01,012 --> 01:14:02,809
This would create a monster.

1060
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,206
Who develops these programs?

1061
01:14:04,206 --> 01:14:06,125
Well, Cocteau lndustries of course.

1062
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,192
But why would the benevolent...

1063
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:11,238
...Dr. Cocteau send such
a brute savage into our midst?

1064
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,151
Well, that's a good question. 
Why don't we go ask him.

1065
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,789
No, John Spartan.You do not accuse 
a savior of our city
of being connected with a...

1066
01:14:16,809 --> 01:14:19,811
...multi-murderdeathkiller like Phoenix. It's...

1067
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,548
...rude.

1068
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,199
I'll be subtle.

1069
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,913
I'm good at subtle.

1070
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,608
Mellow greetings.

1071
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,033
We are happy to welcome you...

1072
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,993
...to the Cocteau Behavioral Engineering 
Complex.

1073
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,149
Be well.

1074
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,276
Enhance your calm, John Spartan.

1075
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:45,830
Mellow apologies for my lack of 
physical disposition Detective...

1076
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:47,905
...but I do have an entire city-gov to run.

1077
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,633
Yeah, well, run this.

1078
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:53,156
You programmed Phoenix's rehab
to turn him into a terrorist.

1079
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,708
And I don't think his escape
was an accident, either.

1080
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,431
-Very subtle.
-Thank you.

1081
01:14:57,520 --> 01:14:59,988
Now, outside the museum, why 
didn't he blow your brains out?

1082
01:15:00,068 --> 01:15:01,387
What did you say to him?

1083
01:15:01,782 --> 01:15:04,012
I honestly don't remember. 
Does it matter?

1084
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,670
Yeah, it matters. I saw the 
security disk.

1085
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,576
He had a full 10 seconds to figure out
where to put 
the hole in your fucking head.

1086
01:15:09,786 --> 01:15:14,520
John Spartan, this display of barbaric 
behavior was 
unacceptable even in your time.

1087
01:15:14,547 --> 01:15:15,721
Yeah...

1088
01:15:16,282 --> 01:15:17,639
But it worked.

1089
01:15:22,027 --> 01:15:27,102
When a man like Phoenix has a gun 
to your head, 10 seconds
is 9 1/2 seconds longer than you live.

1090
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,624
Not everyone is as eager as you...

1091
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:32,872
...to resort to violence to solve 
all the difficulties in life.

1092
01:15:33,601 --> 01:15:39,205
Even now I'm beginning to wonder if the 
chaos in the museum was the result 
of Mr. Phoenix's presence or your own.

1093
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,199
Wonder about this...

1094
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,429
...shithead.

1095
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,910
If you think you got this maniac
under control, trust me...

1096
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,354
...you don't.

1097
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:51,253
Is there something specific you plan
to do with that archaic device?

1098
01:15:51,356 --> 01:15:52,420
John Spartan.

1099
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,432
No, I didn't think so.

1100
01:15:57,164 --> 01:16:01,392
Detective...The only thing I haven't got
under control is you.

1101
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,471
But that can be solved.

1102
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:07,460
You, my Cro-Magnon friend, are dead.
Your family's dead...

1103
01:16:07,456 --> 01:16:08,969
...your past is dead.

1104
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,793
Dead things cannot affect the living. So...

1105
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,149
...enjoy your moment...

1106
01:16:13,226 --> 01:16:17,548
...of prehistoric bravado because
after you leave here it will be over.

1107
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,949
Like everything else in your life.

1108
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,470
Officer, return this man
to cryo-stasis immediately.

1109
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,228
Be well.

1110
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:27,879
Be fucked.

1111
01:16:28,295 --> 01:16:30,517
John Spartan, you are fined 
one credit--

1112
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:38,517
Greetings, Citizen.
How are you on this glorious day?

1113
01:16:39,646 --> 01:16:40,714
I'll wait here.

1114
01:16:41,021 --> 01:16:41,750
Let's go.

1115
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,354
-Oh, I don't know.
-Look, I do know. Now, turn that thing on.

1116
01:16:44,649 --> 01:16:47,450
I hope you know what you're doing.
-Victor 23 degrees

1117
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:50,125
But, you're asking me to disobey 
a direct order.

1118
01:16:50,367 --> 01:16:51,975
I'm to escort you to the cryo-prison.

1119
01:16:51,984 --> 01:16:53,835
Look, you do what you got to
do. I know what I got to do.

1120
01:16:53,824 --> 01:16:56,279
I got to nail that maniac and put
him on ice or that's where I'm gonna be

1121
01:16:56,314 --> 01:16:58,987
-Enhance your calm, John Spartan.
-Look, I've had it with enhancing my calm.

1122
01:16:59,155 --> 01:17:01,355
I'm going to find that psycho 
Phoenix and enhance his calm...

1123
01:17:01,348 --> 01:17:04,160
...and when I'm done, I'm
going to turn my 
attention to that fruitloop Cocteau

1124
01:17:04,965 --> 01:17:07,159
Now, you don't have to come 
with me. I can do this alone, okay.

1125
01:17:07,818 --> 01:17:12,075
Even if Simon Phoenix was programmed
to escape, extinguish 
life, and steal contraband weapons...

1126
01:17:12,097 --> 01:17:13,928
...why are you proceeding into the 
depths of wasteland?

1127
01:17:14,030 --> 01:17:16,743
The reason why your city-wide 
manhunt didn't 
work was because Phoenix

1128
01:17:16,742 --> 01:17:19,066
...was in the one place that 
a: you can't monitor...

1129
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,238
b: are afraid to go and c: don't 
give a shit about.

1130
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,921
Now, I want to go down there, 
I want to find Phoenix
and I want to put him in a hurt locker.

1131
01:17:27,812 --> 01:17:31,212
So, you want to come with me? 
Or you wanna arrest me, huh?

1132
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:34,394
Okay, I'm with you.

1133
01:17:34,665 --> 01:17:36,638
Let's go blow this guy.

1134
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:39,955
Away.

1135
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,838
Blow this guy away.

1136
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,949
Whatever.

1137
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:51,872
She got a way with words.

1138
01:17:58,098 --> 01:17:59,115
What's wrong, Huxley?

1139
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,918
It's not very clean.

1140
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,038
A real garden spot.

1141
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:09,389
Alright, which way Garcia?

1142
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,515
Over there.

1143
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,756
Alright guys, be ready for anything.

1144
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,830
"My dog's better than your dog

1145
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,070
"My dog's better than yours

1146
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,272
"My dog's better 'cause
he gets Kennel-Ration"

1147
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:31,315
I'm sorry, when I'm nervous, l....

1148
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,755
Sorry.

1149
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,759
Over here.

1150
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:56,847
Ooh, what is that emanation?

1151
01:19:01,295 --> 01:19:02,508
Come on guys.

1152
01:19:10,235 --> 01:19:13,611
No, hey just relax. All I want is a 
burger and a beer, if you got one.

1153
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:16,794
How am I gonna pay?

1154
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:19,613
Huxley, It is better to give.

1155
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,955
Want a slug?

1156
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,622
Oh, no, thank you.

1157
01:19:33,696 --> 01:19:35,448
I think I'm going to be sick.

1158
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,708
Oh, God.

1159
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,554
This is fantastic.You guys got 
to try one.

1160
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:42,229
Just don't ask where the 
meat comes from.

1161
01:19:42,609 --> 01:19:43,962
Huxley, what's that suppose 
to mean?

1162
01:19:44,014 --> 01:19:46,005
Do you see any cows around 
here, Detective?

1163
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,155
Rat?

1164
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,313
This is a rat burger?

1165
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,309
Not bad.

1166
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:07,772
As a matter of fact, this is the best 
burger I've had in years.

1167
01:20:10,866 --> 01:20:12,140
See you later.

1168
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,919
They don't seem very hostile,
John Spartan.

1169
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:39,314
No, they don't.

1170
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,515
Now that's a thing of beauty.

1171
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,998
Huxley, do you know what 
this is?

1172
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:58,160
A 1970 Oldsmobile 442.

1173
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:01,835
With a 455-cubic-inch engine.

1174
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:05,065
Radial tires and bucket seats.

1175
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,194
I'm impressed.

1176
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,509
I studied.

1177
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:10,989
So did l. Hand over the glow-rod.

1178
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:13,497
Your friends too. Come on, move!

1179
01:21:21,295 --> 01:21:24,016
You got ball-balls cop, coming 
down here after the show you put on.

1180
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,156
We're looking for a MurderDeathKiller.

1181
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:29,596
Can you help or just bully us
with your primitive weapons?

1182
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,196
Oh, maybe they're not so primitive.

1183
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,398
So, you think you're taking me 
in, huh?

1184
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,515
Guess what?

1185
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,794
Not happening.

1186
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,146
You tell Cocteau he can kiss my ass.
Yeah, that's right.

1187
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,679
You tell Cocteau it's gonna take an 
army of assholes to get rid of me.

1188
01:21:48,681 --> 01:21:50,572
...because I don't give a shit. I got 
nothing to lose.

1189
01:21:50,659 --> 01:21:53,623
I don't wanna rain on your parade, 
pal. But I don't know who the hell 

1190
01:21:53,618 --> 01:21:55,755
you are, let alone wanna take 
you anywhere.

1191
01:21:56,052 --> 01:21:59,089
So stay here, be well
and Cocteau's an asshole!

1192
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,997
Let's take them and dump them up top.
They're only down here to spy on us.

1193
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,314
Wait a minute.

1194
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,116
You're the guy outside Pizza Hut.

1195
01:22:09,502 --> 01:22:11,815
Yeah...What do you want?

1196
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,995
I guess you weren't part of the 
Cocteau plan.

1197
01:22:15,114 --> 01:22:18,603
Greed, deception, abuse of power.
That's no plan.

1198
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,035
-That's why everybody's down here?
-You got that right.

1199
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,155
See....

1200
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,511
According to Cocteau's plan...

1201
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,069
...I'm the enemy because I like to think.

1202
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,469
I like to read.

1203
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,591
I'm into freedom of speech and 
freedom of choice.

1204
01:22:32,626 --> 01:22:34,288
I'm the kind of guy likes to 
sit in a greasy spoon...

1205
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,859
...and wonder, "Gee should I have the 
T-steak or the jumbo rack of 

1206
01:22:36,859 --> 01:22:38,557
barbeque ribs with the side order
of gravy fries?"

1207
01:22:38,563 --> 01:22:39,718
I want high cholesterol.

1208
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,189
I want to eat bacon, and butter 
and buckets of cheese, okay.

1209
01:22:42,302 --> 01:22:45,057
I want to smoke a Cuban cigar
the size of Cincinnati
in a non-smoking section.

1210
01:22:45,324 --> 01:22:48,088
I want to run through the streets 
naked with green jello all over my body...

1211
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,472
...reading Playboy magazine. Why?
Because I suddenly 
might feel the need to, okay pal.

1212
01:22:51,465 --> 01:22:52,815
I've seen the future. You know
what it is?

1213
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:55,105
It's a 47-year-old virgin, sittin' around 
in his space pajamas...

1214
01:22:55,108 --> 01:22:58,020
...drinking a banana-broccoli shake
singin' "I'm an Oscar Meyer wiener."

1215
01:22:58,108 --> 01:22:59,587
You live up top, you live Cocteau's way.

1216
01:22:59,645 --> 01:23:01,715
What he wants, when he wants,
how he wants.

1217
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:04,096
Your other choice: come down here.

1218
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:06,753
Maybe starve to death.

1219
01:23:07,599 --> 01:23:10,311
Alright, then why don't you take charge
and lead these people out of here?

1220
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,549
I'm no leader.

1221
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:13,512
I do what I have to do.

1222
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:15,247
Sometimes people come with me.

1223
01:23:15,681 --> 01:23:20,118
All I want to do is bury Cocteau 
up to his neck in shit and let 
him think happy-happy thoughts forever.

1224
01:23:20,377 --> 01:23:22,129
Then I got bad news.

1225
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,636
I think he wants to kill you.

1226
01:23:27,555 --> 01:23:29,385
All right gentlemen, let's review.

1227
01:23:30,742 --> 01:23:32,433
The year is 2032.

1228
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:36,285
That's 2-0-3-2. As in the 21st century.

1229
01:23:36,875 --> 01:23:41,581
And I am sorry to say that the world 
has become a pussy-whipped...

1230
01:23:41,743 --> 01:23:46,364
...Brady Bunch version of itself
run by a bunch of robed sissies.

1231
01:23:46,685 --> 01:23:49,358
All we have to do to run the whole thing...

1232
01:23:49,381 --> 01:23:53,531
...is to kill a man named Friendly,
who put it all together.

1233
01:23:54,434 --> 01:23:57,361
Ah, but there's an extra added 
bonus.

1234
01:23:58,548 --> 01:23:59,749
We get to kill...

1235
01:24:00,183 --> 01:24:02,413
...the man who put most of us 
behind the freezer.

1236
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:03,605
You mean...

1237
01:24:03,631 --> 01:24:05,303
...we get to kill John Spartan?

1238
01:24:05,577 --> 01:24:06,692
Exactly.

1239
01:24:07,121 --> 01:24:10,507
I want you to loot, pillage,
plunder. I want you to steal.

1240
01:24:10,537 --> 01:24:15,338
I want you to do all the wonderful things 
that we used to do
before any of this happened.

1241
01:24:15,387 --> 01:24:17,343
This world will be ours!

1242
01:24:17,454 --> 01:24:19,406
Let's bring back the good old days!

1243
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,799
Are you with me?

1244
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,156
Are you with me? Let's do it!

1245
01:24:26,263 --> 01:24:30,222
It is a curious conclusion
which you 
have deduced, John Spartan.

1246
01:24:31,121 --> 01:24:33,760
But I can find no fault in your logic.

1247
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:35,873
I mean Phoenix is the perfect 
weapon to send out

1248
01:24:35,879 --> 01:24:37,726
into the savage and other regions
in which we stand.

1249
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,957
I am impressed, John Spartan.

1250
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,674
You mean they thawed this guy 
out just to kill me?

1251
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,863
-I'm flattered.
-Don't be flattered. Be frightened.

1252
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,064
This guy's a certifiable nightmare.

1253
01:24:49,124 --> 01:24:51,792
-And that's why you're down here?
-Yeah

1254
01:24:52,836 --> 01:24:56,272
Huh-oh, ooh...I must have done 
something right in the previous life.

1255
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,749
Can't imagine what that could have been.

1256
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,278
Two for the price of one.

1257
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,112
Let's take them boys.

1258
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,154
Stay down!

1259
01:25:43,141 --> 01:25:46,161
I'll be God damned. Like a 
New York cockroach.

1260
01:26:14,647 --> 01:26:16,285
Everything's gone wrong.

1261
01:26:22,648 --> 01:26:23,926
Phoenix!

1262
01:26:32,009 --> 01:26:33,994
There's an elevator shaft on top
of this place.

1263
01:26:36,091 --> 01:26:37,759
Does that mean we're going up?

1264
01:26:38,269 --> 01:26:40,388
Momentito, Senorita Huxley. Come on.

1265
01:26:58,559 --> 01:27:01,153
How nice! Must've been expecting me.

1266
01:27:17,204 --> 01:27:18,175
Okay, now what?

1267
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,719
Buckle up.

1268
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,077
There he is! He's in my car!

1269
01:27:50,588 --> 01:27:51,941
Goddamn it.

1270
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,735
What is happening to the cops 
today, huh?

1271
01:28:00,034 --> 01:28:02,548
Don't you know you are endangering 
the lives of civilians?

1272
01:28:20,434 --> 01:28:21,264
Auto-inflate!

1273
01:28:21,342 --> 01:28:22,616
Auto-inflate.

1274
01:28:24,652 --> 01:28:25,626
Damn!

1275
01:28:27,336 --> 01:28:28,709
Oh, that is just lovely.

1276
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:30,233
Huxley, drive!

1277
01:28:30,621 --> 01:28:33,035
Okay, okay! I've read all about 
this now, okay.

1278
01:28:35,207 --> 01:28:37,914
So, what do I do? I just, I 
just push this pedal?

1279
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:41,800
Okay, okay! I got it! I got it!

1280
01:28:50,952 --> 01:28:52,226
Punch it! Huxley!

1281
01:28:52,438 --> 01:28:53,578
Excuse me?

1282
01:28:53,644 --> 01:28:56,469
Push the pedal as hard as you can!
Just catch up to 'em!

1283
01:28:56,479 --> 01:28:58,037
Hold on!

1284
01:29:05,494 --> 01:29:06,452
Shit.

1285
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:08,114
No free rides!

1286
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,953
Emergency, doors open.

1287
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,234
Doors opening.

1288
01:29:17,259 --> 01:29:19,382
Say hello to my little friend.

1289
01:29:31,089 --> 01:29:32,007
Doors close!

1290
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,115
Malfunction.

1291
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,317
Computer, auto-drive.

1292
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:42,198
Auto-drive engaged.

1293
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,191
Going to give you a haircut!

1294
01:29:45,825 --> 01:29:47,710
Remember those 40 bus passengers...

1295
01:29:47,846 --> 01:29:50,540
...that you blew apart trying to 
catch me?

1296
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,351
They were already dead.

1297
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,552
Cold as Haagen-Dazs!

1298
01:30:03,634 --> 01:30:06,358
Man, I went to jail with a 36-year 
smile.

1299
01:30:07,186 --> 01:30:08,585
You're dead, Spartan!

1300
01:30:08,751 --> 01:30:10,469
Speak for yourself.

1301
01:30:19,567 --> 01:30:20,477
Self-drive!

1302
01:30:20,473 --> 01:30:22,145
Unable to execute.

1303
01:30:22,317 --> 01:30:24,154
-Self-drive! Now!
-Malfunction.

1304
01:30:24,195 --> 01:30:25,867
Unable to execute.

1305
01:30:26,034 --> 01:30:27,149
Emergency!

1306
01:30:27,647 --> 01:30:29,071
Go left.

1307
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:29,997
Brake!

1308
01:30:31,508 --> 01:30:32,941
Self-drive engaged.

1309
01:30:34,315 --> 01:30:36,780
Brake! Brake!

1310
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:41,216
Brake now! You, Mickey 
Mouse piece of shit!

1311
01:31:12,268 --> 01:31:15,740
John Spartan? John Spartan! 
Are you in there?

1312
01:31:16,313 --> 01:31:17,640
John Spartan!

1313
01:31:17,645 --> 01:31:19,519
Who do you think it is, Huxley?

1314
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:30,192
I thought your life force had been 
prematurely terminated!

1315
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:32,430
Yeah, I thought I was history too.

1316
01:31:32,958 --> 01:31:36,381
What the hell happened? All 
of a sudden,
this car turned into a cannoli.

1317
01:31:36,718 --> 01:31:39,113
It's the secur-a-foam. And It saved 
your life.

1318
01:31:39,642 --> 01:31:41,550
Look at you, you're in shambles.

1319
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,791
Don't worry I can fix it later.
All I need is a needle and thread.

1320
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,453
I really didn't say that? Did I?

1321
01:31:47,971 --> 01:31:49,025
Damn it!

1322
01:31:54,907 --> 01:31:59,149
John Spartan! You, you caveman, 
you're under arrest!

1323
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:02,188
You are to be returned to the 
cryo-prison. Immediately!

1324
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:04,874
I heard all about that. We'll talk 
later, Chief.

1325
01:32:05,511 --> 01:32:08,089
Right now, I need something, anything.
A shotgun, a flare gun.

1326
01:32:08,092 --> 01:32:10,092
-Spartan.
-What?

1327
01:32:12,942 --> 01:32:13,561
Shit!

1328
01:32:13,663 --> 01:32:15,096
Defensive red alert!

1329
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:17,713
Stun batons on.

1330
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:20,289
Relax.

1331
01:32:21,347 --> 01:32:23,262
Well, look at you. You get a bump 
on the noggin...

1332
01:32:23,257 --> 01:32:24,989
...and think you're Pancho Villa?

1333
01:32:25,712 --> 01:32:26,426
Who?

1334
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:27,710
Never mind.

1335
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,279
Time to take a stand, pal.

1336
01:32:29,314 --> 01:32:32,947
Well good. And, while you're doing it,
loan me a gun. Loan me two guns.

1337
01:32:32,987 --> 01:32:36,834
You'd use these weapons of mass 
destruction against men
and women who uphold the law?

1338
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,793
We use these weapons
to shop for groceries, dick.

1339
01:32:39,947 --> 01:32:43,071
Spartan! Wait! You can't leave.

1340
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:47,916
You're under arrest. This very concept
negates the possibility of your leaving.

1341
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:49,633
Skip it, Chief.

1342
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:51,752
Lieutenant Huxley!

1343
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:53,069
Chief...

1344
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:56,197
...you can take this job
and you can shovel it.

1345
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,232
"Take this job...

1346
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:01,919
"...and shovel it."

1347
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,913
Close enough.

1348
01:33:10,120 --> 01:33:14,272
I hadn't counted on this but I must say,
you worked out beautifully.

1349
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:17,151
People are terrified of you.

1350
01:33:17,608 --> 01:33:20,327
What's new? People have always been
terrified of me.

1351
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:23,301
Yes, but this time they're really 
intimidated.

1352
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,349
Now...

1353
01:33:26,942 --> 01:33:30,537
...I'll have carte blanche
to create the perfect society.

1354
01:33:32,165 --> 01:33:33,518
My society.

1355
01:33:34,394 --> 01:33:37,147
San Angeles will be a beacon of order...

1356
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,511
...with the purity of an ant colony.

1357
01:33:41,257 --> 01:33:44,216
And the beauty of a flawless pearl.

1358
01:33:44,223 --> 01:33:46,575
Look, you can't take away people's right 
to be assholes.

1359
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,073
That's who you remind me of...

1360
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:52,568
...an evil Mr. Rogers.

1361
01:33:52,885 --> 01:33:54,398
Will you please kill him?

1362
01:33:54,404 --> 01:33:55,883
He's pissing me off.

1363
01:34:06,136 --> 01:34:07,950
Put another log on the fire!

1364
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,516
I will love runnin' this place!

1365
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:19,879
Well, now...

1366
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,310
...what shall I do with you?

1367
01:34:22,585 --> 01:34:23,685
-Hum, Bobby?

1368
01:34:24,169 --> 01:34:26,537
I am an excellent associate, sir.

1369
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:30,708
I would be delighted to continue 
my services
during your administration.

1370
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,368
Huh, danzig, Maybe we'll use him--

1371
01:34:33,363 --> 01:34:35,290
Excuse me, but the police are here.

1372
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,551
Who in the fuck do you think your?

1373
01:35:22,152 --> 01:35:23,471
I'm impressed.

1374
01:35:36,168 --> 01:35:38,470
That man has died by my hands.

1375
01:35:39,474 --> 01:35:41,112
It was either him or us, Huxley.

1376
01:35:42,177 --> 01:35:43,633
Well, yeah, there is that.

1377
01:35:44,107 --> 01:35:46,257
Anyway, where'd the hell did 
you learn to kick like that?

1378
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:48,918
Oh, um...Jackie Chan movies.

1379
01:35:57,156 --> 01:35:59,873
Looks like the Cocteau plan
just went up in smoke.

1380
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,595
Rest in peace, Raymond Cocteau.

1381
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:07,348
Oh, John Spartan, civilization as 
we know it will come to an end.

1382
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:09,708
What will we do?

1383
01:36:09,845 --> 01:36:12,313
I don't know. But trust me this 
is better for you.

1384
01:36:12,404 --> 01:36:13,803
What's that?

1385
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,639
Oh, this is bad.

1386
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:21,114
This is very bad.

1387
01:36:21,558 --> 01:36:25,034
He's accessed the cryo-prison
and he's about to 
defrost the entire multi-lifer wing.

1388
01:36:25,474 --> 01:36:26,837
Most of them don't like you.

1389
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:30,396
Most of these guys don't even like
their own mothers. 
They're bad boys, Huxley.

1390
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:31,878
How many are there?

1391
01:36:34,982 --> 01:36:35,667
Eighty.

1392
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:37,273
All without rehab.

1393
01:36:37,546 --> 01:36:39,423
And, they'll be re-animated within 
the hour.

1394
01:36:39,634 --> 01:36:41,306
Oh, we must stop this.

1395
01:36:43,079 --> 01:36:47,311
I'm not at all pleased about having 
caused the fatality of 
that deranged cryo-convict.

1396
01:36:47,338 --> 01:36:51,377
I now understand that under certain 
circumstances 
that violence is necessary.

1397
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:52,635
Good.

1398
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:59,230
Then, I hope you understand this.

1399
01:37:08,025 --> 01:37:10,070
I hope my butt didn't look like that.

1400
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:12,879
Okay, who do we have left that's 
good, huh?

1401
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,155
Oh, let's see...

1402
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,713
...Foulks, Patrick.

1403
01:37:16,101 --> 01:37:18,691
Jeffrey Dahmer? I love that guy.

1404
01:37:18,739 --> 01:37:20,691
Look, we got to get him. How 
long before the rest are done?

1405
01:37:20,761 --> 01:37:22,950
They're in the final stages of 
reanimation, sir.

1406
01:37:22,972 --> 01:37:24,885
Great. Absolutely great.

1407
01:37:26,776 --> 01:37:27,845
Gentlemen!

1408
01:37:28,294 --> 01:37:31,604
Thank you very much, 
but your services
will no longer be required.

1409
01:37:38,449 --> 01:37:40,758
Send a maniac to catch a maniac.

1410
01:37:58,304 --> 01:37:59,274
Attention.

1411
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:00,423
Attention.

1412
01:38:01,258 --> 01:38:04,094
Cryo-prisoner defrosting
re-animation sequence...

1413
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:06,447
...now entering final stage.

1414
01:38:07,972 --> 01:38:10,964
Count down to reanimation
of prisoner batches...

1415
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,731
...290, 310, 480...

1416
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:16,473
...and 570.

1417
01:38:16,495 --> 01:38:17,848
Ten minutes.

1418
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,638
-That's it. The very last one.
-Excellent.

1419
01:38:23,884 --> 01:38:24,834
Accessed.

1420
01:38:26,807 --> 01:38:28,152
What the hell is that?

1421
01:39:03,376 --> 01:39:05,125
Didn't expect that one! Did you?

1422
01:39:05,664 --> 01:39:06,865
Where the fuck are you going?

1423
01:39:06,906 --> 01:39:08,538
I wish you the best of luck, sir.

1424
01:39:09,671 --> 01:39:10,626
Stupid.

1425
01:39:17,031 --> 01:39:20,216
Ah, Spartan! How's it hanging, huh?

1426
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,820
Now, I'm sure you're familiar with 
the long arm of the law. Aren't you?

1427
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:32,357
Ah, come on Spartan! Why don't 
you struggle a little 
bit? Make me work for it, huh!

1428
01:39:32,379 --> 01:39:34,176
What do you say? How about...

1429
01:39:34,248 --> 01:39:37,206
...a little target practice. What do you say?

1430
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:47,113
Oops, didn't hurt your head? 
Did you?

1431
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,593
Shit! Goddamn!

1432
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:15,756
Fuck!

1433
01:40:27,708 --> 01:40:28,864
That's this one!

1434
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:31,316
You're not gettin' out of this one!

1435
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:36,714
I could drop you in that vat of 
defrost over there...

1436
01:40:36,752 --> 01:40:38,860
...and fry your ass like a chicken...

1437
01:40:39,842 --> 01:40:42,615
Or with my little pinky, drop 
your monkey ass--

1438
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:47,033
I'll be God damned.

1439
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:28,184
Shit! Goddamn!

1440
01:41:28,328 --> 01:41:29,435
What am I doing wrong?

1441
01:41:29,523 --> 01:41:31,275
Cryo-prisoner re-animation...

1442
01:41:31,275 --> 01:41:34,323
...sequence now entering final stage.

1443
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:43,264
"ls it cold in here, or is it just me?"

1444
01:41:44,887 --> 01:41:46,286
Good memory.

1445
01:41:51,908 --> 01:41:53,145
Come here!

1446
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:54,715
Shit!

1447
01:42:05,503 --> 01:42:06,902
I hate cops!

1448
01:42:10,947 --> 01:42:13,415
Look into my eyes, John. I'll see 
you in hell.

1449
01:42:13,467 --> 01:42:14,377
Not.

1450
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:58,818
This is the best day of my life.

1451
01:43:27,878 --> 01:43:28,670
Heads!

1452
01:44:18,039 --> 01:44:21,863
You have apprehended the villain 
responsible for the murder 
of our beloved Raymond Cocteau?

1453
01:44:21,883 --> 01:44:23,680
Well, I wouldn't exactly say 
"apprehended."

1454
01:44:23,692 --> 01:44:25,125
Let's just say he's history.

1455
01:44:25,613 --> 01:44:26,674
And the cryo-prison...

1456
01:44:26,773 --> 01:44:28,172
...that's history too.

1457
01:44:31,404 --> 01:44:32,631
What'll we do?

1458
01:44:34,042 --> 01:44:34,854
How will we live?

1459
01:44:35,087 --> 01:44:36,832
I'll tell ya what we're gonna 
do. Were 
going to go out drinking. All of us.

1460
01:44:36,886 --> 01:44:40,746
Get shit faced and paint the town, 
literally, put up
graffiti, slogans, it'll be a blast.

1461
01:44:40,763 --> 01:44:42,610
Whoa-Whoa-Whoa! I'm going
to tell you what your going to do.

1462
01:44:43,079 --> 01:44:44,910
Why don't you get a little dirty...

1463
01:44:44,987 --> 01:44:46,099
...you, a lot clean.

1464
01:44:46,751 --> 01:44:48,168
And somewhere in the middle....

1465
01:44:49,573 --> 01:44:50,836
I don't know. You'll figure it out.

1466
01:44:51,753 --> 01:44:52,902
Fucking-A!

1467
01:44:55,949 --> 01:44:56,658
Well put.

1468
01:44:57,351 --> 01:45:00,748
Mr. Friendly. Greetings and salutations,
Edgar Friendly.

1469
01:45:00,849 --> 01:45:03,222
I'm Associate Bob. And may I say...

1470
01:45:03,248 --> 01:45:07,115
...it would be a great pleasure to assist 
you in creating a more humane--

1471
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:09,474
Bob, let's talk about the hair, 
okay?

1472
01:45:09,474 --> 01:45:12,520
-Hair. 
-Pick a color, alright. And lose the kimono.
You look like a couch.

1473
01:45:12,575 --> 01:45:14,172
-Couch?
-What are you, a surgeon
with these gloves?

1474
01:45:19,585 --> 01:45:21,464
Thank you for rendering me 
unconscious.

1475
01:45:23,592 --> 01:45:25,265
Huxley, I did it for your own good.

1476
01:45:25,264 --> 01:45:27,193
-We're supposed to be a team.
-We are.

1477
01:45:35,836 --> 01:45:37,030
Oh, my.

1478
01:45:38,316 --> 01:45:41,013
Are all fluid transfer activities 
like this?

1479
01:45:41,074 --> 01:45:42,666
-Better.
-Better?

1480
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:44,465
Oh, my.

1481
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:49,481
I think I'm going to like 
the future.

1482
01:45:49,973 --> 01:45:51,682
Now that you've demolished 
everything.

1483
01:45:52,633 --> 01:45:54,307
But there's one thing I want 
to know.

1484
01:45:55,205 --> 01:45:58,109
How's that damn three-seashell 
thing work?
