She is Tessa.K.Abraham.

15
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,333
22 years old.

16
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:12,574
One among several girls from Kottayam
who aim at a nursing job abroad.

17
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:55,986
''ls crystal....your body
is a shining crystal..''

18
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:02,691
''Crystal which is hotter
than burning sunlight..''

19
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:16,446
''You are a flower, a girl
dripping with honey..''

20
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,887
''Enthralling beetles
who hover around..''

21
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:37,628
''Breeze from a sandal
forest is coming''

22
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,538
''And cover your flower like body..''

23
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:53,713
''A star appeared on
the sky to watch you..''

24
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:16,931
''ls crystal...on which
golden sunlight shines?''

25
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:30,717
''ls a stone..a stone on the nose
stud which is as bright as moon..''

26
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:39,487
''Colorful butterflies in a
forest of magnolias...''

27
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:46,396
''You are searching for honey in
the songs which are sung..''

28
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:53,810
''A rainbow has descended
from sky to embrace you..''

29
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:30,915
''ls crystal...on which
golden sunlight shines?''

30
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:44,520
''ls a stone..a stone on the nose
stud which is as bright as moon..''

31
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,259
You have got good marks,
good experience...

32
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:16,920
Even then, why haven't you got a visa?

33
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:18,721
Why?

34
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,833
ln your passport it is Tessa Abraham..
in certificates Tessa. K. Abraham..

35
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,063
ln some other cases,
only one 's' for Tessa.

36
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,367
Why is like this?

37
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,708
A smile like this won't do.

38
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,502
First all these complications
need to be cleared.

39
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,239
Then these papers are to be resubmitted.

40
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:37,979
Aren't you from Kottayam?

41
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:38,707
- Yes.

42
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:39,947
Who all are there as relatives?

43
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,815
To go to Trivandrum to
get these things cleared.

44
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,982
l have a younger sister..
but she is in Ernakulam.

45
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:48,257
No one else there...

46
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:52,455
Okay, let's try.

47
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:53,732
But you have to pay us.

48
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,063
That doesn't matter.

49
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:56,325
Tea.

50
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:01,298
Have tea.

51
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,268
Thanks.

52
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,481
Sadanandan...
- Yes.

53
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,679
You donkey..
- What? - This is coffee.

54
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,817
Oh! This is coffee, right?

55
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,081
Get out.
- Ohhh!

56
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:23,820
l am Cyril.

57
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:25,628
lf need be, they will call
you from the office.

58
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,424
You need to come here then only.

59
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:28,924
Okay.

60
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:29,826
Thank you.

61
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:44,312
Will be there they after. Got a
surprise for you. - Tissa Mol.

62
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,453
l am so sorry sir.

63
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:04,861
So you are a nurse?

64
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:05,996
Yes sir.

65
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:06,934
Very nice.

66
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,318
l had been in Kerala for 10 years.

67
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,553
l don't want any apologies.

68
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,305
What's your name?

69
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,136
Tessa.

70
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,273
Bye.

71
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,524
Oh God! l'm so hungry.

72
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,563
Where the hell is she?

73
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,724
She will come.

74
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,234
DK...From Monday l have nigh shift.

75
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,210
Go.

76
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,912
l will go once you go in.

77
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:30,349
Good night.

78
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:31,112
Bye.

79
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:31,812
Bye.

80
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,384
She has come.

81
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:38,822
Come.

82
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:41,225
Got chicken?

83
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,294
Yes there is.

84
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:43,400
Give me that.

85
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,010
My visa is ready.

86
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,440
Really?

87
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,236
- Yes.

88
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,636
l have to go next month.

89
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:56,941
lt's good news.

90
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,015
Then l didn't heed for anything.

91
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,714
Called DK and went for a shopping.

92
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,986
l didn't get those sandals.

93
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,384
But..

94
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,555
How is these?

95
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,223
Great!

96
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:09,488
Hello.

97
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:10,726
How is these?

98
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,330
My visa processing is still in trouble.

99
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,288
ls it?

100
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,098
- Yes.

101
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,668
Some complications with the name.

102
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,935
You can tell DK...He will
help you to clear everything.

103
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,508
He has a special interest
in your affairs.

104
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:25,703
Stop your crap.

105
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:26,636
Why?

106
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,506
God won't give all the
blessings to one person.

107
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:33,881
My life has become
a hell in this hospital.

108
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,913
But one won't feel like
that from the way you eat.

109
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:49,833
Girl..

110
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,800
You are not supposed to toil here.

111
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,339
You marry me.

112
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,875
l will die soon.

113
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:01,210
lsn't it correct doctor?

114
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,473
Good deal!!

115
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:11,021
l have three shops in Thrissur
town...some bank deposit too.

116
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:18,428
l'm getting pension from
government to boot.

117
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,522
That is enough for us to live.

118
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,965
My children need not know about this.

119
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,438
Take rest. l will come later.

120
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,967
Rest in peace!

121
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:43,913
Drink it.

122
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,484
Where are you going?

123
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,856
l have some urgent works.
l will come later.

124
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:53,489
What is your right name?
- Tessa. K. Abraham

125
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,428
K stands for...

126
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,232
- Kurissuparambil.

127
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:59,529
So, you are a cross!

128
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,839
Advocate...Note this...Tessa. K. Ab...

129
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,443
Only after that is finished.

130
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,780
You brute!

131
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:18,282
l never expected such a big surprise.

132
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,783
What's wrong with this?

133
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,220
l'm planning to change like this.

134
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,691
How lengthy was your hair?

135
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,032
Didn't you feel any sense
of loss when you cut it short?

136
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,134
How easy now to maintain this..

137
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,129
After bath it is a matter of just 5 minutes.

138
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,536
Needs to just do like this.

139
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,572
You changed a lot living in
Kochi for just six months...

140
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:41,874
...much more than me who spent
a long time in Bangalore.

141
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,879
Kochi is not the same in the olden days.

142
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,007
That is correct.

143
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,791
What a fragrance!

144
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,325
Like that of orange.

145
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,123
Feel like eating it.

146
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,761
That's why it is made as a body cream.

147
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,466
Tell me..

148
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,107
Okay..

149
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:20,875
Okay.

150
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,015
What happened?

151
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,483
The driver will drop you.

152
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,416
l had promised an outing with my wife.

153
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,252
l forgot that.

154
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:29,884
Okay.

155
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,786
l have taken Rs.3,000 from the purse.

156
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,689
Tessa's younger sister has come here.

157
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,733
Does she have a younger sister too?

158
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:45,741
Did you get Burger?
- Yes.

159
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,003
One is staring at us.

160
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,081
Where?
- Don't look.

161
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:53,875
ls he coming towards us?

162
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,682
Cyril

163
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,486
l know him.

164
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,319
Are you alone?

165
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,149
No..some of my friends are there.

166
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,457
Don't you have friends of your own age?

167
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,362
This is my younger sister- Tissa.

168
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,171
She is my colleague- Jincy.

169
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:14,830
Ohh..Okay.

170
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,067
This is Cyril - Crossover consultancy.

171
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,602
What happened to the other sir's nose?

172
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:21,978
ls he fine now?

173
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,781
That is okay.

174
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,680
He is okay. l talked to him yesterday.

175
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,709
l got really tensed.

176
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,479
Where are you staying?
- Near here Cocks Town...

177
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,752
Nice ass!!

178
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:37,651
Okay.

179
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:39,453
Bye.

180
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,990
What an ass!
l have warned you...

181
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,262
Why on earth did you say
like that in front of him?

182
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:50,299
Do girls love those men
having big buttocks?

183
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:53,872
Have a good day.

184
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,272
Was a little embarrassing.

185
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,717
l have warned you thousand
times....aren't it embarrassing?

186
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,925
What all has she told you about me?

187
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:09,390
That you are the one who
has answers to all questions.

188
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,956
Did she tell you about my proposal?

189
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:13,926
- Yes.

190
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,396
She is not interested.

191
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:17,999
l'm also not interested.

192
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,433
She has become a little aged.

193
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,971
l think you will be perfect.
What's your opinion?

194
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,339
Don't laugh. l was not joking.

195
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:27,975
l have in Thrissur...

196
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,616
...3 shops, bank deposit, pension..

197
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,710
She has exposed the suspense.

198
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,490
l wish God took my life now itself.

199
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,256
This is the moron whom l told you about.

200
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,118
He?

201
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:44,752
- Yes.

202
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,296
Hello!

203
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,264
You are going today?

204
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,438
- Yes. By 8.30 bus.

205
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,298
Meet you next time.
- See you.

206
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,674
l will be back after seeing her off.
- Okay. Bye.

207
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,583
Aren't your father dying there?

208
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,909
Stop gaping and sit somewhere there.

209
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,255
l will call you back. Okay.

210
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,919
Don't look...walk.

211
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,393
l have come to drop Jincy.
- Okay.

212
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,462
She is your younger sister, right?
- Yes.

213
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:20,590
l'm DK.

214
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,061
What's your name?
- Tissa.

215
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,024
Wow!

216
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,292
Tessa!!
Tissa!!

217
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:24,960
Very good.

218
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:26,700
Shall we move?
- Yes.

219
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:27,595
Lift?

220
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:28,400
No, thanks.

221
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,035
DK is a 'set up' of Jincy, right?

222
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,075
Shut up.

223
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,521
You can't work in this hospital for long.

224
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,534
You need to shop some winter cloths.

225
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,906
The temperature in
Canada will drop up to -14.

226
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,646
My God! l was really worried about this.

227
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,511
Applications are through.

228
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,421
You need not be so humble.

229
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,149
lf there is no need, okay.

230
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:22,994
What about a treat?

231
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,562
Okay. But l will drink.

232
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:27,290
Okay..you can.

233
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,823
Okay.

234
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,928
Tessa - Cyril.

235
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,140
Cyril - Tessa.

236
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:42,173
lt's not as matching as Raju-Radha.

237
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,376
Raju and Radha are brother and sister.

238
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,909
Who told like that?

239
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,918
They are a couple.

240
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:54,183
ls there any mention in 'Balarama'
that they are brother and sister?

241
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:57,929
No..right?

242
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,951
Will there be a dooms day in 2012?

243
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,144
l won't say that it will happen..

244
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,321
But by December, there
will be some changes.

245
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,923
That we will have to know
from our own experience..

246
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:33,360
So, we have to finish the
pending works at the earliest.

247
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,190
Correct.

248
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:47,137
Many who come to my office say
that the job of a nurse is thankless.

249
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,472
ls it?
- Yes.

250
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:50,805
l haven't felt like that.

251
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,677
Why should we expect
gratitude for doing ourjob?

252
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,011
Sometimes we will get good tips.

253
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,385
lf we are pressed for money
that time, we will accept it.

254
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,718
l never had any doubt about my
career right from my childhood.

255
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,229
l was born to become a nurse.

256
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,997
l don't know how far Cyril
can understand what l say.

257
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:15,301
But..

258
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,702
My mother was a nurse.

259
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,217
Are you used to drinking?

260
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,978
Can you have one more?
- Okay.

261
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,632
lt seems l only speak.

262
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:51,573
Now it is your turn to speak.

263
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,911
You continue...its fun listening to you.

264
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:00,415
l don't think that l can speak any longer.

265
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,783
lt is like l stepped onto
the podium at school.

266
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,315
You are very used to drinking, right?
- Yes.

267
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,749
l'm a Christian from Kottayam, right?

268
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,447
There will be a bottle on our dining table.

269
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:53,494
ls it not your house?
ls it not?

270
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,439
l will pay for the taxi.

271
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,109
l will pay the bill

272
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,554
But goal..

273
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:33,422
Hello.

274
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,289
Hello.

275
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,526
l was a little fit yesterday.

276
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:37,898
A little only?

277
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:40,438
A little over..

278
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,431
l have got hang over.

279
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,772
Just got up.

280
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,068
Where are you now?

281
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:46,976
l'm in the hospital.

282
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:49,605
l'm just out of the OT.

283
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:50,876
OT?

284
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,514
Operation theater.

285
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,478
There was an emergency laparotomy

286
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:58,013
Which means?

287
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,324
ln some accident cases...

288
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,357
...if there is any internal
injury, the surgeon...

289
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:13,165
...will take out all the internal organs
from the abdomen and replant it.

290
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,164
Only that much.

291
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:16,333
l understood.

292
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,338
l will call you later.

293
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:19,801
Okay.

294
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:20,702
Bye.

295
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:25,707
Gone!

296
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:30,611
Hello
- Yes.

297
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,475
That bystander..

298
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:34,375
Which bystander?

299
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,417
...Of Dr.Jayachandran's patient..

300
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,483
You should see the way he stands.

301
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:44,656
ln the very morning..his
flirting and his vulgar gait..

302
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,720
l feel like slapping him.

303
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:47,656
Rascal!

304
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,834
The person who sent him as
bystander should be blamed.

305
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:58,909
Do you hear anything?

306
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:00,602
What?

307
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,721
Tessa Mol...Tessa Mol...

308
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:41,815
Go go.

309
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,085
Go
- l'm not going.

310
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,354
l tell you...go.

311
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,190
l...
l am not a virgin.

312
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,956
l was in love with one Benny who
was running a medical shop.

313
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,461
l used to go there to buy
medicine for my mother.

314
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:35,337
l felt that l was in love with him.

315
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,433
Now l feel it as nonsense.

316
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:39,632
What was his name?

317
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:41,402
Benny.

318
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:44,909
l thought that he was a good man.

319
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,711
Till that time, l knew only good people.

320
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,281
lt was an accident.

321
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,096
When it came to the stage of
marriage, he fled the scene.

322
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,663
He had a wife and
children in Ernakulam.

323
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,863
l got the entire bad name
right from my school days.

324
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:08,973
lt was a big punishment.

325
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,613
l don't know about the
future of our relationship.

326
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:20,642
But l won't get any peace of
mind, if l don't tell it to you.

327
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:25,716
l also wanted to tell you one thing.

328
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:31,421
The sound is not 'faa', but 'bhaa'.

329
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:33,721
'Bhaa'.

330
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:34,888
'Faa'.

331
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:35,599
'Bhaa'.

332
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,758
l'm saying the same.

333
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,234
Not 'faavi', but 'bhaavi'.

334
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,230
'Bhaavi'.

335
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:41,430
'Faavi'.

336
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,100
No...'Bhaavi'.

337
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,777
l'm saying the same - 'Faavi'.

338
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:49,240
Yes you are right.
- What is the matter?

339
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:51,274
'Feautiful'!!

340
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,476
l am saying the same, right?

341
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,913
Okay, you are correct, perfect.

342
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:24,814
''Snow which slowly kills, burning girl..''

343
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:31,850
''You are far too a destination
that few can reach you..''

344
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:24,097
''Oh twilight! Oh breeze,
Oh thorn, Oh rose, Oh petal..''

345
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:37,615
''Oh ember, Oh shade..''

346
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,696
l will go after some days, right?

347
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:26,226
- Yes.

348
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,273
Can you stay with me till that.

349
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:51,128
''Oh wings, Oh clear sky..''

350
00:33:51,929 --> 00:34:00,633
''Breeze which wafts across my mind..''

351
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:16,980
''Oh dream..Oh sea..''

352
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,757
''Slowly...''

353
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,460
''Slowly...''

354
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:46,610
''Snow which slowly kills, burning girl..''

355
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:53,554
''You are far too a destination
that few can reach you..''

356
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,671
Hey..What you doing?

357
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,942
What's this, Cyril?

358
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:30,571
Come.

359
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,181
Hey..Cyril...

360
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:32,773
Come.

361
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,477
What happened?
- Nothing. l will tell you..come.

362
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:41,957
Didn't he leave after dropping you?

363
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,359
Not that..l started a little early
today as l have duty in the casualty.

364
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,125
Still out of range.

365
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:50,397
Nothing to worry..don't be tensed.

366
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,692
Not that...yesterday's problem...

367
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,463
That still stirs in my mind.

368
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,636
Must have reached home.

369
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,638
Try once more.

370
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,776
The customer you are
calling is unavailable.

371
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,875
You can leave message...

372
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:22,195
The customer you are
calling is unavailable.

373
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:54,461
Sir..Cyril...

374
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,225
Wasn't there an incident yesterday?

375
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,259
- Yes.

376
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:02,498
Cyril hit the son of the Karnataka
Rakshanavedi's secretary.

377
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,270
They are after him to chop off his hand.

378
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,873
The issue has been solved
after some discussions.

379
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,716
Nothing to worry.

380
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,281
lt is safe to be in hiding for two days.

381
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,916
He is in my farm house now.

382
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:23,757
No mobile coverage
there to contact him.

383
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,461
Give the phone to Cyril.

384
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:39,867
Tessa...

385
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,902
l didn't expect it to become
as serious like this.

386
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,481
l was really scared.

387
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,106
l know.

388
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,878
Hegde sir has interfered
to solve the problems.

389
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,681
l will be backing home in two days.

390
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:51,811
Okay?

391
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:53,647
Okay.

392
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,357
How is your hand?

393
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,521
That's okay.

394
00:39:58,929 --> 00:39:59,588
l am fine.

395
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,703
Don't worry.

396
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:08,403
We can meet after two days.

397
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,231
Have you watched this movie?

398
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,671
Cyril should see this situation
with a matured mind.

399
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:38,477
You should convince her that the
incident is not a big disaster in her life.

400
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:43,679
Only a few of us know
about this incident.

401
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:51,056
At this time when the visa is ready...
Tessa also demanded the same..

402
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,591
lf this news is leaked out to the media.....

403
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,026
The management is also concerned
about the goodwill of the hospital.

404
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:18,179
Cyril...

405
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,022
Three stitches on Tessa's head.

406
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:25,426
A finger is fractured.

407
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,827
Bite marks are seen all over the body.

408
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:33,163
She needs you at this moment.

409
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:37,239
Understand that....go and sit near her.

410
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:39,668
Please...

411
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:41,973
Please...

412
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:21,629
Cyril...

413
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,363
l want to kill him.

414
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,001
Everyone told me to be practical.

415
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:30,478
But l can't be practical.

416
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,082
Please Cyril.

417
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,356
l only pray for hanging on
somehow till l leave.

418
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:48,621
We have a way before
us to start a new life.

419
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,794
How do you behave
so normally, Tessa?

420
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,502
Looking at me, do
you feel that l'm normal?

421
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:02,268
Now l don't even know
how one feels so normal.

422
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,411
l'm unable to erase
his face from my mind.

423
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,610
Then, what about me?

424
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:16,320
l see my own weeping face when l
close my eyes...do you know that?

425
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,308
l don't want to commit suicide.

426
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,476
l only need a life with you.

427
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,684
You don't understand what l say, right?

428
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,122
Something else is disturbing you.

429
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:57,423
What else?

430
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:03,129
Has anything changed between
us because of this incident?

431
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:04,804
What do you mean?

432
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:06,298
Tell me.

433
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,937
Oh God Tessa..l haven't
thought like that.

434
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,410
Cyril...

435
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,188
You hurting me Cyril.

436
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:27,621
Tessa...

437
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,238
Was shifted to the lCU yesterday.

438
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:45,130
Still critical.

439
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,905
Do you want to see him?

440
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:52,975
l will be leaving next week.

441
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:56,182
Don't feel sad.

442
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,118
Cyril is here with you.

443
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:04,657
This is the worst period
of time in your life.

444
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:06,258
l know.

445
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:11,801
lf you recover fast, Cyril
will also become normal.

446
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:17,498
Tessa...

447
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:29,211
Cyril...

448
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:42,855
Cyril...

449
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,984
Don't get scared.

450
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:46,019
Don't get scared.

451
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:54,497
Where is Cyril?

452
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,032
l want to apologize to both of you.

453
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,274
He is like my brother.

454
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:04,748
l'm a patient undergoing treatment.

455
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:05,612
Cyril...

456
00:53:06,149 --> 00:53:06,911
Cyril...

457
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,214
l can't sleep.

458
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:14,616
lf l don't take medicines...

459
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:25,033
But after that incident
between us, l slept well.

460
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:21,113
Lord...if possible kindly takes
back this grail from me...

461
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:24,724
Let Lord's wish prevail and not mine..

462
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,311
First time it was my commitment.

463
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,925
Haven't you borrowed
a lot of money from me?

464
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,529
For that l have worked hard.

465
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:09,338
She would have gone like any other girl.

466
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,707
l don't want to go anywhere.

467
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:19,714
He is a brute.

468
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:27,755
No other girl should have
such an experience.

469
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,026
Won't you be with me?

470
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:36,657
What did you say?

471
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:38,292
l'm with you.

472
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:48,744
Not we...you are in trouble.

473
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:51,107
l'm still with her.

474
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,212
You only have something to lose.

475
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,511
What will you do now?

476
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:33,613
Money is not a constraint.

477
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:02,375
Shall we go?
- Yes.

478
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:14,722
You wait here.

479
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:15,796
l will come with the bike.

480
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:16,522
Okay.

481
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:32,010
Give the bag. l have to check it.

482
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,182
Give the bag.

483
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:50,524
Cyril!

484
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:51,764
Sir...look.

485
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,262
Where did you get it?

486
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:57,066
l don't know.

487
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,201
Come on.

488
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:07,675
Cyril!

489
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:27,774
Bloody cold!

490
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:34,880
Madam...

491
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:36,849
Yes..come...come.

492
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:45,195
Come.

493
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,001
Give me the file.

494
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:48,396
Give me that.

495
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:51,763
Move this side.

496
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:55,676
What is your name?

497
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,448
l ask you bloody...

498
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:01,806
Tessa.

499
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:03,548
Full name?

500
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:05,611
Tessa. K. Abraham.

501
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:07,514
Your's?

502
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:09,013
Bobby's Meroona.

503
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,786
Check them.

504
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:17,628
Remove your dress.

505
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:32,375
Remove.

506
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:35,711
Remove quickly.

507
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,113
Quick.

508
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,455
Sit like this.

509
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,125
Don't you understand?

510
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:48,931
Move legs.

511
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:50,764
Understood.

512
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,636
l will take care of the nurse.

513
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:03,210
You are nurse or drugs?

514
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:09,714
Why all Malayalee
girls come for nursing?

515
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,217
Which hospital?

516
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:12,916
CMC.

517
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,851
How many years of service?

518
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:16,581
Two.

519
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:19,224
Do you know Tamil?

520
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:21,153
Yes.

521
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:24,427
Go to cell with your luggages.

522
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,797
There is a woman called Subaida.

523
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,263
She is born criminal.

524
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,774
Give her some respect.

525
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:33,770
She is pregnant also.

526
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:35,907
Take care of her well.

527
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:36,907
Understand?

528
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:38,844
Take them.

529
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:30,783
Do you know Tamil?

530
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:34,724
Did Jailor said everything?

531
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:35,720
Come.

532
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,259
Massage my legs.

533
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,199
lt has become wooden.

534
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,903
lt is hard to give birth to a child.

535
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:47,672
Come here.

536
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:21,971
Look what that police lady did to me.

537
01:06:57,313 --> 01:06:58,007
Come here.

538
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:12,820
Come here.

539
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:22,531
Did you commit any crime?

540
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:27,036
l asked you only.

541
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:31,877
No.

542
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,015
l can see it in your eyes.

543
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,477
But l won't tell you not to cry.

544
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:40,886
God is seeing all those.

545
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:45,750
Good, bad all those understand to Him.

546
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:50,488
Go and sleep peacefully.

547
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,898
Are you tensed?

548
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:35,595
No.

549
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:42,304
We must took her to hospital soon.

550
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:44,810
Take rest.

551
01:09:53,589 --> 01:09:54,112
Come.

552
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,352
Subaida is very weak.

553
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:05,124
Be careful on her till
shifted her to hospital.

554
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,440
Am l going to die?

555
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,224
l know that this is not going
to be a normal delivery.

556
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:39,222
Always all of you will
try to save the mother.

557
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,866
But you must change that for me.

558
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,472
Even if l die, my child should alive.

559
01:10:46,675 --> 01:10:48,074
Nothing will happened to you.

560
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:53,977
l don't know that l am
pregnant when l kill them.

561
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:56,881
l won't do that if l knew it.

562
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,223
lt is difficult to get
released from jail by killing...

563
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:05,794
...the Mayor and his brother
those who killed my husband.

564
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:11,462
lf l was outside they
won't spare me and my child.

565
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:13,900
Jail is safe.

566
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,497
Now l was alive to give birth to my child.

567
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:46,994
Do you know Pankajam's story?

568
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:47,960
No.

569
01:11:48,337 --> 01:11:50,430
She has been here for the past 8 years.

570
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:53,634
Her husband, a drunkard.

571
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:59,437
He raped his own daughter after drunk.

572
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:03,946
Without suffering that she killed him...

573
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:07,546
...give poison to daughter
and she hanged up herself.

574
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:14,319
But some scoundrels saved her...

575
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:17,564
...and put her in jail in order to
kill her husband and daughter.

576
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:25,000
Because of hanging she
can't speak anymore.

577
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:26,769
See that?

578
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:32,076
Everyone here has a different tale to tell.

579
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:47,592
What is this?
Are you going to open a shop in jail?

580
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:50,260
No. These want to
give to all those in jail.

581
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,264
This is for that.

582
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:52,991
Everyone must be happy.

583
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,700
ls it?
- Yes.

584
01:12:54,770 --> 01:12:55,964
How are you?

585
01:12:56,071 --> 01:12:58,403
l am fine.
And you?

586
01:12:58,474 --> 01:12:59,065
Yes.

587
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,608
Why are you looking so dull?

588
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:04,676
lt is a boy!

589
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,313
How is your business?

590
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:08,573
Now it is dull season.

591
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:10,375
2 tamil movies are flops.

592
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,247
Your phone is ringing.
- Okay.

593
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,890
l change the ringtone yesterday.

594
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:21,223
Where are you?

595
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:22,862
l am in jail.

596
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,193
ln jail? What happened?

597
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:25,398
Nothing.

598
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:26,892
l came to see my sister.

599
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,936
ls it? - Yes.
Talk at outside.

600
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:30,930
Call you later.

601
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:34,767
Did the doctor check you recently.

602
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,034
Everything is good.

603
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:37,638
She is with me.

604
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,679
She will take care of everything.

605
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:41,173
Her name is Tessa.

606
01:13:41,617 --> 01:13:42,743
She is a smart nurse!

607
01:13:42,951 --> 01:13:44,009
She is from Kerala.

608
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,050
What? 'lssa'?

609
01:13:46,321 --> 01:13:48,789
Not 'lssa' mother - Tessa.

610
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:53,289
Are you proper Kerala?

611
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:53,918
- Yes.

612
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,696
l have a friend in Kerala.

613
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:56,560
Very famous.

614
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:57,689
Mattanchery Martin.

615
01:13:57,800 --> 01:13:58,391
Do you know him?

616
01:13:58,667 --> 01:13:59,190
No.

617
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:00,596
Why don't you know?

618
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:03,060
He is very famous!

619
01:14:03,405 --> 01:14:04,997
A fat one with beard.

620
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:06,499
Super quotation!

621
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:08,031
Keep quiet.

622
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:14,115
His name is Cyril Mathew, right?

623
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,782
He is not much famous.

624
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:24,286
But he is an important one
for some special circles.

625
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,353
He came to Bangalore 4 years ago.

626
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:28,921
Now he is in Cochin.

627
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:32,826
The last girl that he deal
was a Malayalee nurse.

628
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:34,736
That is you?

629
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,101
After Hegde...

630
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:41,170
Big land lord!

631
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:45,004
Already his name is in a case
of raping an 8 year old girl.

632
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:47,176
lt's okay.

633
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:51,911
You are trapped in a super team.

634
01:16:27,549 --> 01:16:28,709
This is me.

635
01:16:29,851 --> 01:16:35,153
l don't have the humor sense to
enquire about your well being there.

636
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:45,366
Last week a decision was
taken regarding my left hand.

637
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:53,870
Before my game is over,
l need to tell you something.

638
01:16:54,843 --> 01:17:00,042
l have spent so many days
in different hospitals.

639
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:06,744
l have met so many
efficient doctors and nurses.

640
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:17,164
But there is something
special in your eyes - kindness.

641
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:22,731
Your life should not end in that jail.

642
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:28,032
You should learn more, work more.

643
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:34,915
l have bequeathed half
of my wealth to you.

644
01:17:35,951 --> 01:17:38,511
l didn't have any problems
to give you the whole.

645
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:47,653
But my children might turn
against you if l do so.

646
01:17:49,097 --> 01:18:01,168
This world remains a good place to live
only because of a few people like you.

647
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:11,246
''Life is a heaven
and you an angel''

648
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:20,292
Daughter....

649
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:25,194
Bye

650
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,295
Bye

651
01:19:19,721 --> 01:19:20,312
Sister...

652
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:21,579
Sister...

653
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:24,015
What happened?

654
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:26,522
No problem.

655
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:27,723
No problem.

656
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:33,195
One minute.

657
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:34,231
l will call someone.

658
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:35,630
One minute.

659
01:19:38,173 --> 01:19:38,969
Warden...

660
01:19:39,641 --> 01:19:40,471
Warden...

661
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:42,703
Some one please come.

662
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:55,752
Warden...

663
01:19:57,025 --> 01:19:58,117
Some one please come.

664
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:03,420
Sister...

665
01:20:04,432 --> 01:20:04,955
Sister...

666
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:07,898
Warden...

667
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:09,895
Who is that?

668
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:12,929
Warden...

669
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:13,934
Who?

670
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:15,508
Who is making noise?

671
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:18,242
Don't be tensed.

672
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:21,072
Warden...

673
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:22,444
Who?
Open.

674
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,682
Call the doctor.

675
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:24,975
What happened?

676
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:27,184
l will call the doctor.
Open quickly.

677
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:28,279
Wait...

678
01:20:29,257 --> 01:20:30,918
Bullshit! lt won't open.

679
01:20:31,026 --> 01:20:31,993
Call the doctor.

680
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:35,854
What happened?

681
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:37,891
Nothing to worry.

682
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:39,725
We will go to hospital in a short while.
Nothing to worry.

683
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:41,062
Where is the doctor?

684
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:44,839
Did you get him in phone?

685
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:46,998
Sister...

686
01:20:47,809 --> 01:20:48,571
Nothing to worry.

687
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:50,102
We will go to hospital.

688
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:52,504
l am trying.

689
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:53,710
He is not attending the call.

690
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:54,904
Not attending?
- Yes.

691
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:55,912
What will we do now?

692
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:58,381
Tessa...can you do something?

693
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:01,049
Get me some hot water.

694
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:03,154
Call the jailor.

695
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:07,351
l can't Tessa.

696
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,330
l did a lot of crimes in my life.

697
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:12,396
l can't.

698
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:13,864
No sister, you can.

699
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,696
Nothing..l am with you.

700
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:17,764
Nothing sister.

701
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:18,662
Nothing.

702
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:19,330
l am with you.

703
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:43,521
Sister...

704
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:48,893
Sister...

705
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:51,002
Listen to me sister.

706
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:56,341
Don't be tensed.

707
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,513
l am with you. You must do
everything. Listen to me.

708
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:01,606
Sister...

709
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:06,977
Sister...

710
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:09,587
l can only help you.
You must push.

711
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:10,947
Sister...

712
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:12,383
Push sister...

713
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:14,050
You must push.

714
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:27,602
Thank God!

715
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:29,866
Come on.

716
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:37,976
Tell the doctor that
she have high bleeding.

717
01:22:59,074 --> 01:23:00,006
Tissa Mol!

718
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:02,803
You need not worry about me.

719
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:08,809
Now l'm in a very safe place.

720
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:16,115
Even if something happen, l get
the training to face it from here.

721
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:20,891
Don't create a scene.

722
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:27,390
Can't l cry?

723
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:30,434
Name?

724
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:32,999
Bonny.

725
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:34,431
Place?

726
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:35,402
Vypinkara.

727
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,342
We worked together, right?

728
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:49,186
Meet the advocate.

729
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:53,293
You should meet him before leaving.

730
01:23:56,131 --> 01:23:59,430
l have enough with me for
both of us to live comfortably.

731
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:02,330
You should not be sad.

732
01:24:03,838 --> 01:24:04,463
No.

733
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:06,837
Nothing to worry.

734
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:20,444
Bye.

735
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:31,190
Look baby! Who you saw first.

736
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:50,770
''How to live comfortably, when
there is no way forward''

737
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:58,377
''Can anyone tell me a
way to overcome this?''

738
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,788
''lsn't there a destiny for everyone..''

739
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:05,116
''How to live comfortably''

740
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:10,459
lt has been a long time
since l sang a song.

741
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:14,733
l want to kill a person.

742
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:25,902
Don't misunderstand.

743
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:28,613
l didn't say that you can't.

744
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:31,145
l got laughed when you say suddenly.

745
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:36,320
There are two villains in your story, right?

746
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:40,654
ls it enough if one is killed?

747
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:44,956
Yes.

748
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:47,264
You want to go out and kill?

749
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:57,805
l don't take cases now a days.

750
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:01,570
Because of breathing problem, l can't.

751
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:03,105
Sign there.

752
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:07,820
l will give instructions on what you
are supposed to say in the court.

753
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:09,688
Say only that.

754
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:14,025
lt will be easier as there
are no past convictions.

755
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:19,128
Even if this fails, we can
arrange it with money.

756
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:21,701
Not that. That is for the officials.

757
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:22,860
Okay.

758
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:40,310
Tessa...

759
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,520
You need a help outside the jail.

760
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:53,832
l have a friend named Dinesh.

761
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:55,864
l will introduced you to him.

762
01:27:57,538 --> 01:27:59,802
What will you give him?

763
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:04,877
We are born with a weapon.

764
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:07,711
That's both our problem and power.

765
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:14,154
What all he hears?

766
01:28:55,496 --> 01:28:59,626
Anyway your jail life didn't
become a futile affair.

767
01:29:00,668 --> 01:29:01,600
Okay. We will do it.

768
01:29:16,217 --> 01:29:17,684
While doing it, you should do it perfectly.

769
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,114
Others should feel it as a natural death.

770
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:23,115
Subaida is an old friend.

771
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:24,752
l will help you.

772
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:27,216
l don't want anything for free.

773
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:30,628
Nothing will be available for free.

774
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:39,897
Since you mentioned it...l prefer
it to be offered wholeheartedly.

775
01:29:42,009 --> 01:29:46,571
We should all love...
always we should love.

776
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:51,885
We should love as many
persons as possible.

777
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:54,844
Does Jincy call you?

778
01:29:57,992 --> 01:29:59,653
Yes..some times.

779
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:06,624
l'm not Jincy.

780
01:30:09,103 --> 01:30:10,695
l'm one who was raped twice...

781
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:14,470
...am out from the jail after being
convicted in a drug case.

782
01:30:18,579 --> 01:30:21,639
lsn't there a courage when
have nothing more to lose?

783
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:27,420
Now l have only that with me.

784
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:33,224
Hello
- Everything is fine?

785
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:39,549
Who?

786
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:18,716
Tessa!

787
01:33:23,564 --> 01:33:24,428
l'm a patient.

788
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:30,696
l'm a patient.

789
01:33:31,405 --> 01:33:32,429
Aren't you a nurse?

790
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,099
You know it, right?

791
01:33:37,078 --> 01:33:38,010
l'm a patient.

792
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:50,116
You are a patient for me.

793
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:58,330
But, you can be cured with death.

794
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:51,042
Cobra in the cover.

795
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:56,282
lf you budge, it will bite.

796
01:34:59,593 --> 01:35:03,427
The poison will affect the diaphragm
which helps the lungs to breathe.

797
01:35:07,668 --> 01:35:08,965
You will die because of suffocation.

798
01:35:12,173 --> 01:35:13,470
Maximum 30 minutes.

799
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:23,407
Bitten.

800
01:35:25,653 --> 01:35:26,381
Don't get scared.

801
01:35:27,788 --> 01:35:30,450
lf the blood pressure increases,
death will be faster.

802
01:35:32,693 --> 01:35:35,787
But l know, you got scared.

803
01:35:42,937 --> 01:35:46,464
Now l will watch from here you dying.

804
01:36:02,356 --> 01:36:04,517
Everyone will get angry.

805
01:36:05,092 --> 01:36:07,287
Majority of them are killing in that angry.

806
01:36:08,696 --> 01:36:12,928
The people is very less who is
standing in front of the dead body...

807
01:36:13,033 --> 01:36:16,867
...with braveness on thinking
that it is correct to kill.

808
01:36:19,373 --> 01:36:23,400
On killing him, l saw his
soul going through his eyes.

809
01:36:26,347 --> 01:36:28,975
At that time, we are like Gods!

810
01:37:24,038 --> 01:37:25,266
When do you want the delivery?

811
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:29,901
By 16th.
- 16th is 1, 2, 3..

812
01:37:31,245 --> 01:37:32,075
How can l help you?

813
01:37:36,717 --> 01:37:40,915
Don't spoil my life by digging up the past.

814
01:37:42,056 --> 01:37:43,523
lt was a mistake.

815
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:48,324
lf Rosy's relatives come to know
about this, l will be finished.

816
01:37:49,763 --> 01:37:52,698
Even Bible says to forgive the sinners.

817
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:58,700
How much you have changed!

818
01:37:58,906 --> 01:37:59,895
Where have you been?

819
01:38:01,842 --> 01:38:07,007
Do you know that my youngest daughter
is given your name - Tessa Benny.

820
01:38:10,484 --> 01:38:14,420
There is a model agency in
the Chittoor route run by a Cyril.

821
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:15,948
'Looksmart'

822
01:38:16,690 --> 01:38:17,884
What should l do?

823
01:38:43,284 --> 01:38:43,773
Good.

824
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:47,178
l will call you when an assignment
suitable for you arrives.

825
01:38:47,321 --> 01:38:48,413
E-mail the photos.

826
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:50,816
You should meet this girl.

827
01:38:51,158 --> 01:38:51,715
Please sir.

828
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:54,560
Wherever you want..she
is ready for any adjustments.

829
01:38:54,962 --> 01:38:55,428
You...

830
01:39:00,734 --> 01:39:01,598
How was the shoot?

831
01:39:04,471 --> 01:39:06,302
l will....in half an hour.

832
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:08,030
Okay?

833
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:08,833
Will meet in the flat.

834
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:10,209
Sure.

835
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:11,773
What's the name?

836
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:12,776
Prarthana.

837
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:13,879
Your name?

838
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:14,914
Benny.

839
01:39:15,749 --> 01:39:20,209
Hundreds of profiles like this
come to this office everyday.

840
01:39:20,688 --> 01:39:22,815
Many are ready for such adjustments.

841
01:39:23,324 --> 01:39:24,586
My job is different.

842
01:39:25,192 --> 01:39:29,595
Hard work and talent are
essential to survive in this field.

843
01:39:29,997 --> 01:39:31,589
Details are here...we will contact you.

844
01:39:31,899 --> 01:39:35,391
This case is very important for me.
You should meet this girl.

845
01:39:35,736 --> 01:39:37,067
She is really talented.

846
01:39:37,237 --> 01:39:38,261
Won't you understand
things if explained?

847
01:39:39,106 --> 01:39:40,073
l have another appointment.

848
01:39:40,507 --> 01:39:40,996
Bye.

849
01:39:55,055 --> 01:39:55,578
Benny...

850
01:40:10,971 --> 01:40:11,630
Prarthana?

851
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:12,896
Yeah.

852
01:41:00,687 --> 01:41:01,517
You know Malayalam, right?

853
01:41:02,589 --> 01:41:03,112
Yes.

854
01:41:33,987 --> 01:41:36,114
lf you come with another name,
heavy make up and a sun glass...

855
01:41:36,223 --> 01:41:37,349
Did you think that l can't recognize you.

856
01:41:37,458 --> 01:41:38,720
Aren't a man who slept with you?

857
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:00,678
You....

858
01:42:03,684 --> 01:42:04,912
Joker Benny!

859
01:42:07,788 --> 01:42:09,380
You are just a nurse.

860
01:42:43,023 --> 01:42:46,083
You are just a woman...
understand that.

861
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,762
l can't live without you.

862
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:02,407
This is Tessa.

863
01:44:47,247 --> 01:44:48,111
lt's not hangover.

864
01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:51,610
You are under sedation.

865
01:44:54,721 --> 01:44:58,452
ln your last glass it was
not just champagne.

866
01:45:09,002 --> 01:45:13,939
When you were unconscious, l
surgically removed your male organ.

867
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:29,816
ln medical terms, it is
known as penectomy.

868
01:45:32,259 --> 01:45:33,851
A tube is fitted for urination.

869
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:45,297
You will have some
difficulties in the beginning.

870
01:45:47,941 --> 01:45:48,873
Then, it will be alright.

871
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:43,227
Minimal movements only..there
are two lines of stitches.

872
01:46:45,966 --> 01:46:48,434
The effect of local anesthesia
may have reduced.

873
01:46:49,536 --> 01:46:53,233
You have unbearable pain....right?

874
01:47:11,725 --> 01:47:14,216
You have experienced
only pleasure from there.

875
01:47:16,363 --> 01:47:18,194
Are you able to understand pain now?

876
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:27,334
You may have emotions now.

877
01:47:29,576 --> 01:47:34,570
But the sex you celebrated,
traded is no more for you.

878
01:47:39,519 --> 01:47:44,752
You won't stand before
a girl confidently.

879
01:47:56,536 --> 01:47:57,093
Hello.

880
01:47:57,604 --> 01:47:58,536
ls it not over?

881
01:47:59,172 --> 01:47:59,695
No.

882
01:48:01,942 --> 01:48:06,811
This won't end without making Cyril
understand what he has done to me.

883
01:48:07,848 --> 01:48:08,371
Okay.

884
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:10,544
l will call you later.

885
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:25,123
Take this.

886
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:28,934
Antibiotics to prevent infection.

887
01:48:32,305 --> 01:48:32,896
Don't want?

888
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:36,536
Are you planning to kill me
after torturing like this?

889
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:37,499
No.

890
01:48:39,779 --> 01:48:42,646
lf l want to accomplish my
mission, you should stay alive.

891
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:48,116
l will be here till this wound heals.

892
01:48:55,428 --> 01:48:58,295
Aren't l a nurse from Kottayam.

893
01:49:14,147 --> 01:49:16,115
Didn't you mention
about killing a person?

894
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:17,474
l want to kill him.

895
01:49:18,818 --> 01:49:19,785
l killed him.

896
01:49:44,945 --> 01:49:46,503
l told you to have the medicine?

897
01:49:52,218 --> 01:49:53,480
You feel angry, don't you?

898
01:49:56,022 --> 01:50:00,823
When one sees things out of control
for the first time in life, one will get angry.

899
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:03,159
Manhood is not the
6 inches you chopped off.

900
01:50:03,997 --> 01:50:05,225
You haven't understood me well.

901
01:50:06,166 --> 01:50:06,928
Yes, l have.

902
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:13,232
A person who has spoiled
the lives of many girls.

903
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:15,870
Yes..so many...l will do it again.

904
01:50:19,446 --> 01:50:20,913
How much did you get when you sold me?

905
01:50:21,247 --> 01:50:22,475
l will use those whom l like.

906
01:50:22,616 --> 01:50:23,241
Then l will sell them.

907
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:25,108
l reached till here doing this business.

908
01:50:25,685 --> 01:50:26,515
Till where?

909
01:50:29,322 --> 01:50:30,016
Till this bed?

910
01:50:39,699 --> 01:50:41,929
Do you think that you will go alive from
here after putting me in this condition?

911
01:50:47,173 --> 01:50:50,165
Even after doing this much
against me, aren't you still alive?

912
01:50:59,619 --> 01:51:03,020
When called Cyril sir, the
phone is switched off.

913
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:04,955
We reached only a little while before.

914
01:51:05,892 --> 01:51:06,950
He is asleep.

915
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:08,893
Will be on leave for two days.

916
01:51:10,597 --> 01:51:11,222
Bye.

917
01:51:35,255 --> 01:51:36,381
God is with me.

918
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:44,119
l still survive only because
of my belief in God.

919
01:51:49,169 --> 01:51:54,004
When you recognized me yesterday,
l thought it was the end of my life.

920
01:51:57,610 --> 01:52:00,773
l didn't think that l was in disguise
in front of a professional fraud.

921
01:52:06,019 --> 01:52:07,145
But you didn't kill me.

922
01:52:10,657 --> 01:52:11,885
Do you know why?

923
01:52:18,565 --> 01:52:20,226
l'm still somewhere in your heart.

924
01:52:23,369 --> 01:52:24,768
You have not been able to forget me.

925
01:52:28,475 --> 01:52:29,169
lsn't it Cyril?

926
01:52:45,058 --> 01:52:49,119
You only created the Tessa
who sits in front of you.

927
01:52:54,801 --> 01:52:55,859
l was a different person before.

928
01:52:59,339 --> 01:53:03,571
Sending me to jail was the
biggest mistake you committed.

929
01:53:14,687 --> 01:53:15,813
When l looked around...

930
01:53:17,090 --> 01:53:22,995
...l saw a number of women who are
wounded, who have seen death nearby.

931
01:53:32,605 --> 01:53:34,163
l became more confident
about my survival.

932
01:53:50,957 --> 01:53:55,724
l consider Hegde's attack
against me as a dog bite only.

933
01:53:58,097 --> 01:53:58,961
But you...

934
01:54:03,670 --> 01:54:04,364
Doesn't matter.

935
01:54:08,441 --> 01:54:12,275
What l lost is one who sold me.

936
01:54:15,148 --> 01:54:21,519
But you lost one who
loved you so much.

937
01:54:25,058 --> 01:54:27,219
Do you know what position
you had in my mind?

938
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:49,105
Cyril!

939
01:55:07,166 --> 01:55:08,929
l want a life with you.

940
01:55:57,016 --> 01:55:58,813
l will leave by the evening flight.

941
01:56:01,287 --> 01:56:01,912
You need not worry.

942
01:56:04,223 --> 01:56:05,190
You are safe now.

943
01:56:07,927 --> 01:56:09,986
l think you have understood
what you ought to understand.

944
01:56:13,533 --> 01:56:16,297
l thought a lot about the
punishment to be given to you.

945
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:22,874
Even l empathized with your mother.

946
01:56:25,945 --> 01:56:29,210
But l couldn't think about
anything less than this.

947
01:56:34,153 --> 01:56:34,915
Tell me the truth..

948
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:38,082
Are your mother a nurse?

949
01:56:38,825 --> 01:56:39,314
Yes.

950
01:56:46,265 --> 01:56:47,630
Why should l lie now?

951
01:56:49,002 --> 01:56:49,969
My mother was a nurse.

952
01:56:51,437 --> 01:56:55,874
How come you are
able to lie so blatantly?

953
01:56:58,611 --> 01:57:00,078
lf she doesn't understand
even after repeating it...

954
01:57:00,646 --> 01:57:01,476
She don't know Malayalam.

955
01:57:01,547 --> 01:57:02,013
What?

956
01:57:04,984 --> 01:57:06,975
'Bhaava vettyasam'..'Bha'.

957
01:57:09,322 --> 01:57:10,016
Not 'faa'.

958
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:10,856
'Bha'.

959
01:57:13,426 --> 01:57:13,915
'Bha'.

960
01:57:19,032 --> 01:57:20,124
Didn't l say the same?

961
01:57:22,802 --> 01:57:23,325
Okay.

962
01:57:40,253 --> 01:57:41,049
Aren't you from Kottayam?

963
01:57:42,488 --> 01:57:43,147
No one for me.

964
01:57:46,993 --> 01:57:48,017
lt will dip to -14.

965
01:57:49,962 --> 01:57:51,122
My mother was a nurse.

966
01:57:53,399 --> 01:57:54,889
Will you stay with me till then?

967
01:58:00,139 --> 01:58:01,163
l want to kill him.

968
01:58:19,725 --> 01:58:21,659
l will use those whom l like.
Then l will sell them.

969
01:58:23,896 --> 01:58:24,885
You are just a woman.

970
01:58:48,855 --> 01:58:49,514
Bye Cyril.

971
01:58:56,662 --> 01:59:01,395
l can't tell what is in your mind
by looking at your face.

972
01:59:06,205 --> 01:59:08,469
lf you still want to settle scores with me...

973
01:59:11,010 --> 01:59:12,671
l'm going to Canada.

974
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:16,615
You can come there.

975
01:59:19,952 --> 01:59:20,418
Bye.

976
01:59:28,694 --> 01:59:29,217
Tessa...

977
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:42,104
You are a woman.

978
01:59:51,217 --> 01:59:55,517
l will come at a time when l can.

979
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:01,690
To meet you.

980
02:00:35,194 --> 02:00:35,683
Hello.

981
02:00:36,562 --> 02:00:37,028
Tessa...

982
02:00:39,899 --> 02:00:41,025
l'm going home.

983
02:00:42,201 --> 02:00:43,828
Son is down with fever.

984
02:00:44,804 --> 02:00:45,702
ls it okay if l call after l reach there?

985
02:00:46,339 --> 02:00:48,204
No..l will call after reaching there.

986
02:00:48,808 --> 02:00:49,866
Okay.

987
02:01:21,207 --> 02:01:25,405
This is not just a story of a girl
who was repeatedly cheated.

988
02:01:26,646 --> 02:01:29,114
Tessa K. Abraham is a reminder.

989
02:01:30,082 --> 02:01:34,746
A reminder that a woman's
endurance is not her weakness.

990
02:01:44,497 --> 02:01:54,065
''ls crystal.....your body
is a shining crystal..''

991
02:01:56,275 --> 02:02:00,905
''Crystal which is hotter
than burning sunlight..''

992
02:02:04,650 --> 02:02:14,616
''You are a flower, a girl
dripping with honey..''

993
02:02:16,495 --> 02:02:20,955
''Enthralling beetles who hover around..''

994
02:02:24,770 --> 02:02:34,668
''ls crystal...on which
golden sunlight shines?''

995
02:02:37,817 --> 02:02:48,386
''ls a stone..a stone on the nose
stud which is as bright as moon..''
