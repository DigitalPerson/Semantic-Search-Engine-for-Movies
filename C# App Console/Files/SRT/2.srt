1
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,240
Johann Goethe is 23 and studies law.
He talks a lot and drinks no less...

2
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,600
Today is his doctoral examination.

3
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,960
The doctoral exam...

4
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,280
Goethe. Spelled with an "oe."

5
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,680
Do you know the exact wording
of the Augustinian Principle?

6
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,040
Of course.

7
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,440
Yes?

8
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,000
What is it?

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,680
The wording?

10
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,360
The principles of common law
are not only categorical but also...

11
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,560
Is not much rather
Augustus himself a...

12
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,360
3...

13
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,360
principle of

14
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,400
me, you, us? A principle of us.
Doesn't the assumption

15
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,840
that it is more of a principle
than of actual existence

16
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,440
make his principle
and its exact wording irrelevant?

17
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,840
At least in principle.
Maybe it's both or reversed or... or...

18
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,000
The young man is boldly crazy.

19
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,680
Boldly crazy? Nut at all!

20
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,400
Boldly crazy is a child
who kills his mother and father

21
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,400
and calls for mercy
because he's now orphaned.

22
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,280
That is crazy...

23
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,960
and bold.

24
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,120
Failed.

25
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,360
You should have
opened a book now and then.

26
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,080
Namely a textbook.
- Nut this nonsense by Lessing,

27
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,280
<i>Shakeslear</i> or whatever
those scribblers are called.

28
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,440
And best regards to your father!

29
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,240
Our dear Goethe, spelled "oe."

30
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,680
Cold without a doctoral cap?

31
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,520
We should write
a few lines to Goethe senior.

32
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,800
KISS MY ASS!

33
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,960
Goetz, colon.

34
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,000
“Give me

35
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,880
some water to drink."

36
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,360
Freedom.

37
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,920
“Goetz von Berlichingen."

38
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,840
It is done.

39
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,320
Shit!

40
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,600
<i>What's this? Get off! - Express mail.
It has to be in Leipzig tomorrow.</i>

41
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,520
I see.
- It's the original. There's no copy.

42
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,240
I trust you.

43
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,920
Seems quite important.
- Important? My life is at stake!

44
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,720
<i>YOUNG GOETHE IN LOVE</i>

45
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,080
<i>The nymph hurries off
into the forest's delight.</i>

46
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,960
<i>The lark soars and whirs.</i>

47
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,320
<i>Calls.</i>

48
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,480
<i>The silky green shimmers</i>

49
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,240
<i>in boundless glory...</i>

50
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,560
Johann, you old scoundrel. - What are
you doing at this horrid reading?

51
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,960
I was about to ask you the same.
- Everything but listening.

52
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,080
Beauty fosters sweet hurt...
- I bet he rhymes it with "heart."

53
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,000
<i>and breaks my golden heart.</i>

54
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,640
Such grandiloquence!
- Even worse: People like it

55
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,320
Where is true art?
- Mine has been sent off. - Really?

56
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,520
Out of your brain, onto the page?
- In the mail...

57
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,040
<i>Off and away.
- Goetz von Berlichingen done and sent?</i>

58
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,520
I dare bet it'll be published in no time.
- To true art!

59
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,120
The wildest thoughts!
Passionate. Abysmal. And forbidden.

60
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,200
Against reason. -Against rationality.
- Against the rules.

61
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,480
To passion.
- To "Sturm"... - and drink!

62
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,680
TWO WEEKS LATER

63
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,840
Child's play!

64
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,720
All of it is child's play!

65
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,160
King of Thule! Erl King!

66
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,680
How old are you?

67
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Let me be, Father.
- I let you belong enough.

68
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,320
"Filling wood and vale you cast
Quiet misty sheen

69
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,760
And for once release at last
All my soul serene."

70
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,760
What is this nonsense about?

71
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,440
It is addressed to the moon.

72
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,120
<i>To the moon?</i>

73
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,240
Are you a woman or a man?

74
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,000
Just so you know,

75
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,360
I refuse to finance this ridiculous
scribbling and rhyming any longer.

76
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,840
The highest order of reasoning is...
- If I do as you say.

77
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,280
Exactly!

78
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,640
Exactly.

79
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,480
I wrote Kammermeier, who is President
of the Supreme Court of Justice.

80
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,400
They'd offer you an apprenticeship.
- In Wetzlar, that godforsaken backwater?

81
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
Never!
- It wasn't meant as a question.

82
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,560
Am I interrupting?

83
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,160
This just arrived for you from Leipzig.

84
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
Well, here you go, Father.

85
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,000
From now on,
you may well stop financing me.

86
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,280
Because from now on, my ridiculous
scribbling will support me just fine.

87
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,280
"...Thank you for your manuscript.

88
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,080
It is certainly proof of great diligence
and effort... we have to inform you

89
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,600
that we consider your play
to be completely free of all talent...

90
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
unbelievable characters,
bumbling rhymes,

91
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,440
a call to take justice
into one's own hands."

92
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,520
One of life's lessons
is to recognize your abilities

93
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,680
and your inabilities.

94
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,160
My sun,

95
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,160
you will surely become
an outstanding lawyer.

96
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,440
Why?

97
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,600
Excuse me?

98
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,920
Why are you here?

99
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,440
I'd like to be taught justice justly.

100
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,880
And beyond the self-evident?

101
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,840
Practice.

102
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,680
The license to practice...
- Your credentials

103
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,240
do not speak of great effort. Denied!

104
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,040
He is the spitting image of his father!

105
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,160
Kestner,
accommodate this young man.

106
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,960
If I understood Goethe senior correctly,

107
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,320
his sun is a bit of a silly fellow,

108
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,720
writing poems and such.

109
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,720
We are to cure him.
- As you wish, Mr. President.

110
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,160
Shouldn't these be put away?
- These are pending cases, Sir Scholar.

111
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,560
I see. -All employees
are subject to a dress code and rank.

112
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,960
That'll do.

113
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,440
No lady visitors. Do you fence?

114
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,200
Nut really.

115
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,640
Room and board
are provided by the court.

116
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,440
Family disputes of the years '47 to '51:

117
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,760
Catalogue, categorize,
and submit them to the court.

118
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,360
Sir Scholar, your desk.

119
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,280
Did you drop something again?

120
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,400
Wilhelm Jerusalem.

121
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,160
Johann Goethe. My pleasure.

122
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,240
D-d-do you dance?

123
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,840
This is awful.

124
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,160
Wetzlar isn't Strasbourg, you know.

125
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Funerals are more fun.

126
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,360
G-g-gentlemen...

127
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,200
Shit!
- I am sorry, Sir. Oh, God...

128
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,320
Yes, it's alright. - Oh, God.
It suits you well, though. - What?

129
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,920
Red.

130
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,440
Lawyer.
- Why? - No sense of humor.

131
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,400
Hold on! And you are?

132
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,120
Tipsy.
- And unbridled.

133
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,120
And not interested.

134
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,480
Lucky for me.

135
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,400
Would you care to dance?

136
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,280
Nut interested.

137
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,080
Lucky for me.

138
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,160
What a lump!

139
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,160
I wish she had run into me.
- Yes, then my jacket would be clean.

140
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,360
Quiet!
- I am quiet.

141
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,360
Want to join me for a nightcap?

142
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,320
But only one.

143
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,040
Good morning, gentlemen.

144
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,320
Morning.

145
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,920
The documents
requested by our magnanimous master.

146
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,160
Thank you.
- The pleasure is all ours.

147
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,760
Unworthy as we are
- Yes. - Yes - Yes.

148
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,040
Thank you.
- Much obliged. - Much obliged.

149
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,920
I wish to have all of this processed
within the next 48 hours.

150
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,840
If nut, your employment here
is terminated immediately.

151
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,800
Do you hear that?

152
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,640
Damn beautiful.

153
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,720
A small break?

154
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,840
That's your b-bumpkin.

155
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,640
<i>Will you come to rehearsal tomorrow?
- I can't. I have to bake and wash.</i>

156
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,360
And your maid?
- She left. - What?

157
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,720
We couldn't afford her.

158
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,000
Ladies!

159
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,160
Have we met?
- At the dance.

160
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,400
I almost didn't recognize you,
without the stain.

161
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,360
Same here, without the tipsiness.

162
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,200
You are impertinent.
- You are unbridled, boisterous,

163
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,320
and supremely...

164
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,880
Well, wouldn't this be the moment
to introduce yourself.

165
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,560
I am Johann Goethe.

166
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,560
May I?

167
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,000
Saddle up and move! Right now!

168
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,280
What's this?
- Unforeseen events force me

169
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,560
I am Lotte,
Lotte Buff from Wahlheim!

170
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,000
Lottie!

171
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,040
You will certainly remember
our dear Counselor of Justice, Kestner.

172
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,520
Well, certainly.
- I have to praise you.

173
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,400
Miss Buff, you sang marvelously,
truly marvelously.

174
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
You look so inspired.

175
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,880
Probably the effect of church.

176
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,960
Could I possibly pay you a visit
for afternoon tea next Sunday,

177
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:07,280
or perhaps a little walk, if you please?

178
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,640
You are more than welcome, Mr. Kestner.

179
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,640
The Counselor seems to have
taken a liking to you. - You think?

180
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,960
You'll surely like him too.
- He seems decent.

181
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,320
A capable man, and wealthy too.

182
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,840
I wouldn't have thought
you capable of this.

183
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,200
And you, even less.

184
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:56,000
The Court assumes you have learned
your lesson and will abstain from any

185
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,840
future excesses.

186
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,200
The gentlemen are dismissed
for the rest of the day.

187
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,480
We should go for a ride.
- Later.

188
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,240
Now.
- Must we?

189
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,840
Yes, we must.

190
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Come!

191
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,440
You can't go like that.

192
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,680
It's all I have.
- Hold on.

193
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,680
Gentlemen.
- Goethe, quite a daring outfit.

194
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,560
Complementary colors.
- How about green-red or pink-ochre.

195
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,280
Or orange-lilac?

196
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,920
You scoundrel!

197
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,040
You bastard-fart!

198
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,400
“In a

199
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,400
quiet

200
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,680
midday slumber,
mother earth is resting in her lair.

201
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,120
The sun god

202
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
banishes

203
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,240
all anguish

204
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,360
with its golden hair."

205
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,320
Who wrote that?

206
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,440
Nobody. It just...

207
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,720
popped into my head.

208
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,760
A poet.

209
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,200
I once thought so.

210
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,040
But?

211
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,800
Nobody else did.

212
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,360
Particularly not my father.

213
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,040
We could make a short detour.
- To this village?

214
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,720
To Wahlheim.

215
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,160
Wait!

216
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,240
<i>How do I look?</i>

217
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,440
Irresistible.

218
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,560
What do you want?

219
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Aren't you the Buff family?
- Maybe. We have nothing to give.

220
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,800
Anna, there are two beggars at the dour.

221
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,200
We are looking for the lady

222
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,360
who sang so beautifully last Sunday.
- At the church.

223
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
Lotte-Popotte, visitors!

224
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,120
For me?

225
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,880
The honorable Mr. Goethe. And Mr...?

226
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,080
Wilhelm Jerusalem.

227
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
You look very...

228
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,760
blue-yellow, Mr. Goethe.

229
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,240
It's the latest craze. Yes.

230
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,880
In Paris.

231
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,520
So which ones

232
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,920
are actually yours?
- All of them!

233
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,440
They're all my siblings.

234
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,760
Of course. - We're right
in the middle of baking bread.

235
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,920
As chance would have it,
he's an extraordinary baker's helper.

236
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,200
Careful, it's hut!

237
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,600
Snatched up!
- I want the biggest.

238
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,800
I want a piece.

239
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,400
Who will be first out to the yard?

240
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,520
Mr. Goethe, would you like some too?
- Yes, please.

241
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,000
Hmm, tasty. With thyme.

242
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,720
Good palate.

243
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,880
Our dear late mother
always baked it like that.

244
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,360
I try to make it like she did, for them
- How long

245
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,480
has she been...
- A year.

246
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,040
<i>Good.</i>

247
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,880
I lost once again.
- It seems you like losing. - I'll start.

248
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,520
I'll start over again.

249
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,720
What... 7
- That was mean!

250
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,680
<i>Bona nox, you are a real ox.</i>

251
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,840
<i>Buona notte, dear Lotte!
Bonne nuit, fie, fie!</i>

252
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,080
<i>It'll be a long way home. Good night!
Hit the sack, make it crack!</i>

253
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,560
<i>Sleep safe and sound.
Twist your ass to your mouth all around!</i>

254
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,480
Sing a round!

255
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,080
Miss Buff, with that voice
you should perform on stage.

256
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,640
How true!
- Father would never let her.

257
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,840
Just like Johann's father.
- Why?

258
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
He would have liked to become a poet.

259
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,800
And his father wouldn't allow it?
- Yes, and rightly so.

260
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,280
What did you write?

261
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,080
Well, poems that nobody wanted to read.

262
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,600
And a play

263
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,480
that nobody wanted to print.
- I love plays.

264
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,280
I read Emilia Galotti three times.
- And cried each time.

265
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,960
What I wouldn't do

266
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,360
to see that play on stage just once.

267
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,920
Be very still now.

268
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,040
Would you mind reciting something?

269
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,040
I would like to hear that too.

270
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,680
Perhaps some other time.

271
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,320
It is very late too.

272
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,120
Mr. Jerusalem,

273
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,000
honorable Mr. Goethe,

274
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,360
It was a great pleasure
to have you here.

275
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,480
Sleep well.

276
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,880
How could you possibly
have let yourself be tempted

277
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,400
to engage in such grave misconduct?

278
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,880
Even the challenge
makes one liable to prosecution.

279
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,240
We are not here to judge
your opponent's death,

280
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,600
but your tempting him

281
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,560
to engage in an illegal duel.

282
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,080
Thank you.
- I demand two years in prison.

283
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,080
Granted.

284
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,560
The verdict takes immediate effect.

285
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,240
Please proceed with preparations
for the next case.

286
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,360
Are the papers
for the Schwerdtlein case ready, Goethe?

287
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,280
Yes, of course.

288
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,520
When, if you please,
did you write this list?

289
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,440
Just before the hearing began.

290
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,560
Very fast.

291
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,320
Sir Scholar,
you are very fast and fired up today.

292
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Solely your outer appearance
leaves something to be desired

293
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,880
Please, Mr. Counselor.

294
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,120
Why don't you write her first?

295
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,000
If I write her first, I deprive her
of the opportunity to write to me first.

296
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,480
But if Miss Buff thinks the same,
hence not writing you first,

297
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,600
so as not to deprive you
of the opportunity to write her first,

298
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,360
then...
- All love is lust.

299
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,160
Miss Buff, please wait!

300
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,600
Please wait! Miss Buff...

301
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,320
oh!
Sir?

302
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,520
I mistook you for someone else.
I'm sorry.

303
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,520
Well then, have a good day, gentlemen.

304
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,000
My fair young lady, may I be so daring

305
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,440
as to lend you my arm and companion?

306
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,800
I'm not a lady.

307
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,040
But fair!
- Yes.

308
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,120
Or would you rather
go home without his care?

309
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,320
Oh, God! I'm sorry.

310
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,640
If you go on like this, we'll eat off
the? our. - Yes, you're right.

311
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,760
Quite charming, that Mr. Goethe,
don't you think?

312
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,520
Plays the clavichord,
likes baking bread.

313
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,360
Quite entertaining for a lawyer.

314
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,040
I'm expecting an important letter.
- Your name would help.

315
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,360
Goethe, spelled with an "oe."
- Goethe...

316
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,000
No, I'm sorry.

317
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,240
You sure?
- Quite sure.

318
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,360
Did a letter arrive for me?
- No. For the third time, nu!

319
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,600
You sure?
- I'm sure.

320
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,760
No.

321
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,400
I only wanted...
- No!

322
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,800
No, nu, nu.

323
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,800
There was no one but her

324
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,400
and me.

325
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,560
You should have seen
how she smiled at me, the entire time.

326
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,960
And then she suddenly had to leave.

327
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,480
And why?

328
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,720
She didn't say.

329
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,160
Mr. Goethe,

330
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,520
something did arrive for you after all.
- What did I tell you?

331
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,400
Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

332
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,240
From my Papa

333
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,680
Want to know what I think?
- No.

334
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,120
Alright.

335
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,560
I have to go to town.
- What?

336
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,840
We don't have enough sugar.
- But there is at least

337
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,400
another pound...
- That will never be enough!

338
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,280
Is your sister home?

339
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,080
Which one?

340
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,600
Mr. Goethe?

341
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,800
She went to Wetzlar.

342
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,480
What a surprise.
What are you doing here? - I just wanted

343
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,000
to visit Mr. Goethe.

344
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,760
But he's visiting you.

345
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,560
Mr. Goethe!

346
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,240
What a coincidence.

347
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,680
Crazy!
- Where are you going?

348
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,560
I went to the market.

349
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,720
And you, my dear Werther?

350
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,440
Your dear Werther is riding around,

351
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,480
admiring the scenery
and just riding around.

352
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
Well?

353
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,080
What?

354
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,120
Will you recite something for me today?

355
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,040
Perhaps another time?

356
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:13,200
You won't get away with that today.
- It's kid's stuff, all of it.

357
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,880
I beg you.
- It is ridiculous scribbling

358
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,160
and rhyming.

359
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
You are just a coward.

360
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,560
Discreet.

361
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,680
Cautious.

362
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,520
Humble.

363
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,840
Very well, I will not breathe again
until you've recited something.

364
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,680
That is boldly crazy.

365
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,880
And absurd too, Miss Buff.

366
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,400
I'm impressed
and you will give up in no time, I know.

367
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,040
Yes, well...

368
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,240
Miss Buff!

369
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,720
50?

370
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,920
What are you doing?

371
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,040
Alright then...
- No, please, nu!

372
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,600
Stop it! Alright, you win.

373
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
<i>Quick</i>

374
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,080
<i>beat my heart: to horse!
Haste, haste,</i>

375
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,800
<i>And lo!</i>

376
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,640
<i>'twas done with speed of light;</i>

377
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,320
<i>The evening</i>

378
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,240
<i>soon the world embraced,</i>

379
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,160
<i>And o'er the mountains
hung the night.</i>

380
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,400
<i>I saw thee,</i>

381
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,040
<i>and with tender pride</i>

382
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,440
<i>Felt thy sweet gaze pour joy on me;</i>

383
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,280
<i>While all my heart was at thy side.</i>

384
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,440
<i>And every breath I breathed</i>

385
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,480
for thee.

386
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,680
Ridiculous.

387
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,120
It is truly ridiculous...

388
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,480
that you don't believe in yourself.

389
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,760
Tell me...

390
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,240
wouldn't this be the moment?

391
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,760
Which moment?

392
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,080
The one where you kiss me.

393
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,480
I am so hungry!
- Father is almost dune.

394
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,920
I want to eat now!

395
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,760
I don't want soup.
- You'll have soup!

396
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,440
Anna, why isn't the table set yet?

397
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,800
Where have you been?
- Went for a walk.

398
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,120
I thought you went to buy sugar.

399
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,520
<i>That too.</i>

400
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,800
She needs to have her diaper changed.
- So?

401
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,160
Your dress is ruined.
- I'll hang it up to dry.

402
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,040
Have you ever been in love?
- Yes.

403
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,280
Shit.

404
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,800
How foolish!
You are usually so reasonable.

405
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,640
Now of all times.

406
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,400
Going for a walk in the rain.

407
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,040
This kind of reading

408
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,280
obviously confuses you.

409
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,480
And help her with her hair.

410
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:29,280
Gorgeous lilies. Right, Charlotte?

411
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,880
Yes, Father.

412
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:37,320
Lilies are Lotte's favorite flowers.

413
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,160
I made a good choice then.

414
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:53,000
A walk, I assume, is currently
out of the question, Miss Buff.

415
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,840
I'm very sorry, Mr. Counselor.
- Surely at a later date. - Sure.

416
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,560
Sure.

417
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,880
I think...

418
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,800
the flowers need water and a vase.

419
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,400
For the water. - Of course.
- In the kitchen. Come!

420
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,560
Are you coming?

421
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,080
Here we are,
and I'm at a loss for words.

422
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,280
<i>Do you know Emilia Galotti?</i>

423
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,280
Nut personally.

424
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,600
It is a play.

425
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,920
By Lessing.

426
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,840
I... have heard of it.

427
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,520
See you soon.
- See you soon.

428
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,400
Father says...
- I know what Father says.

429
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,960
He says, if he marries you,
we won't lose the house.

430
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,480
And the buys can go to school.

431
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,880
Beautiful!

432
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,040
What will be performed?
- Her favorite play. - Emilia Galotti?

433
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,640
She'll be beside herself with joy.

434
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,400
Yes, if she can't go to the theater...
Please pull.

435
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,120
The theater will come to her.

436
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,680
And you will play Galotti.

437
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,240
I will unfortunately have to decline,
Mr. Theater Director.

438
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,800
I already have a role in my own drama.

439
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,640
With a happy ending, I hope.

440
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,080
Yes.

441
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,520
She wants to leave her husband for me.
- Her husband?

442
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,760
Yes.

443
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,960
We will run away
and live happily ever after.

444
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,800
I know it.

445
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,960
Ah! Goethe, back on your feet.
- Yes,

446
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,240
quicker than I thought.

447
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,680
The Ravensburg files will arrive shortly.
Get started on them right away.

448
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,680
Oh, Goethe,

449
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,680
do you hunt?

450
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,920
I'm not a great marksman.
- We'll change that.

451
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,920
Did I hit it?
- Almost.

452
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,240
You shouldn't hesitate.

453
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,680
That's of utmost importance
when hunting.

454
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,160
As soon as you see the target,

455
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,880
shoulder your gun,

456
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:39,440
aim,

457
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,280
shout. Bang. Dead.

458
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:48,080
You have to be dispassionate,
cold-blooded. That's all.

459
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,040
I'll try it next time.

460
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,880
You are much too sensitive.

461
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,280
Chest hit.

462
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,240
Nut bad. - I fought in '61.
That's how you learn to shout.

463
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,720
<i>It'll make a good stew.
- Do you cook?</i>

464
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,800
No, I will leave that

465
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,120
to my future wife.

466
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,880
Really? You are engaged? - Everything's
been arranged with her father.

467
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,640
I merely have to propose to her
and get that over with.

468
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,240
What's stopping you?
- I fear I won't find the right words.

469
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,240
Unfortunately, the young lady
is interested in literature.

470
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:34,920
Oh, well then...
You'll have to win her over with style

471
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,560
and passion!
- Easier said than dune.

472
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,760
Well, perhaps...

473
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,640
You enter her room
and ask her to close her eyes.

474
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,960
And then?
- You slip a ring on her finger.

475
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,360
She opens her eyes,
sees the ring, and then...

476
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,680
you'll say something like...

477
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,160
"It is love,

478
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,960
that holds the world
together at its cure."

479
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,680
That's good.

480
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,520
That is very good.
- But with passion!

481
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,120
I should send you instead.

482
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:24,040
Courage is all you need!

483
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,000
A visitor!

484
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,200
Mr. Counselor, what a surprise.

485
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,080
You look much better, Miss Buff.

486
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,360
Yes, the doctor you so kindly
sent over was of great help.

487
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,960
He's a fine fellow and
an old acquaintance from the military.

488
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:54,200
Would you ask him

489
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:59,040
not to request his payment
until next month.

490
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,160
But I insist on paying for it.

491
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,480
I don't know how to thank you,
Mr. Counselor.

492
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,600
Your actions
are so very generous

493
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,920
I'll make us some tea.
- Wait!

494
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,760
The Counselor
would like to tell you something.

495
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,680
Sit down, Lotte.

496
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,360
Close your eyes.

497
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,400
You can open your eyes again.

498
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,600
Miss Buff?

499
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,640
I don't know what to say.

500
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,520
I am delighted as well.

501
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,640
Children, come in. There is...

502
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,480
There is great news!

503
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,960
Come in!

504
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,440
Miss Buff...

505
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,320
Be quiet now!
- Charlotte...

506
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,200
It is love

507
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,360
that holds

508
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,120
the world together

509
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,840
at its cure.

510
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,800
That was well put.

511
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,160
Ma! I hope?

512
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,160
Yes, Mr. Kestner.

513
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,680
You may.

514
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,760
Thank you.

515
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,360
My dear Werther!

516
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,200
<i>Circumstances demanded</i>

517
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,200
<i>engaged today.</i>

518
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,600
<i>I kindly ask you to refrain</i>

519
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,240
<i>from any further visits.</i>

520
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,000
<i>My heart is so heavy.</i>

521
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,480
Mr. Goethe,
please come into my office immediately.

522
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,960
<i>Your Charlotte Buff.</i>

523
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,440
Goethe?

524
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,760
Thank you.

525
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:21,440
Did she accept?
- And she was overjoyed.

526
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,120
For me, and I'm sure for her too,
it was probably...

527
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,640
the greatest moment of our lives.
- I'm happy, truly happy, Mr. Kestner.

528
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,120
Albert.

529
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,440
Now more than ever.
- Johann.

530
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,960
We're getting together tonight
to celebrate the happy news.

531
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,840
I would be delighted...
- I'd like to, but...

532
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,000
But you have to meet her!
- Yes, some other time.

533
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,840
Tonight, I have my own romantic duty.
- No!

534
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,280
Yes.

535
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,720
So, is she still under siege
or did you conquer her walls already?

536
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,560
The walls have tumbled.

537
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,680
Well, then you are naturally excused.

538
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,520
Counselor.

539
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,160
Mr. Goethe!

540
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,760
When I saw Charlotte again,

541
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,360
the little girl from long ago

542
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,840
had turned into a delicate
and respectable young woman.

543
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:05,200
So it is with great pleasure that I
announce to Lotte's family and of course

544
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,200
to my dear colleagues

545
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,360
my, nu, our successful...

546
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,480
our successful engagement today.

547
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,720
Miss Buff!
- Mr. Goethe!

548
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,280
I do hope I'm not intruding, but
I've brought a little surprise for you.

549
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,280
Haven't you received my letter?
- What letter?

550
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,640
Lotte!
- There you are!

551
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,480
Yes. I'll be right there.
- Who is it?

552
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:58,760
Father, this is

553
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,400
Johann Goethe.

554
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,600
From the court.

555
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,000
A late guest! My favorite kind.

556
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,760
Charlotte, some port for Mr. Goethe,

557
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,760
the good stuff.

558
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,000
You do like port?

559
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,480
Yes, please.

560
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,160
Johann?

561
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,560
I'm so happy you made it!

562
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,840
A must wonderful surprise.

563
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,000
I thought
you had your own romantic duty.

564
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,880
May I introduce my charming fiancée?
Charlotte Buff.

565
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,360
Johann Goethe,
my best man at the court,

566
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,520
and my friend.

567
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,800
Well, pleased to meet you.

568
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,960
Indeed, pleased to meet you.

569
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,680
Congratulations.

570
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,160
Thank you.
- So, let's drink

571
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:29,280
to the engagement
of Charlotte and Albert.

572
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,360
Might that be a gift, Johann?

573
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,320
Yes.

574
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,960
A paper theater.

575
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,800
<i>Emilia Galotti.</i>

576
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,680
Did you hear that, Lotte?

577
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,280
Isn't that the play

578
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,720
you like so much?

579
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,600
Mr. Goethe!

580
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,640
Will you play

581
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,640
something on the clavichord again?
Please! -Another time.

582
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,440
I don't think Mr. Goethe

583
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,760
will be visiting very often any more.

584
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,400
Weren't you about to take your leave?

585
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,400
Yes. Yes, I was.

586
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,800
Miss Buff.

587
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,840
Mr. Buff.

588
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,440
Counselor of Law.

589
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,360
Charlotte,

590
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,840
don't you have anything
to say to the Counselor of Law?

591
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,840
It was...

592
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,280
It was before our engagement.

593
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,840
You will not see Mr. Goethe again.

594
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:58,400
Of course nut.

595
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,320
In that case

596
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,640
I will take my leave.

597
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,440
Mr. Goethe!

598
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,600
Another letter has arrived for you.

599
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,240
I know.

600
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,320
My child?

601
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,640
What's it about anyway?

602
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:19,880
Emilia is taken by a rich man
although she loves someone else.

603
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,720
In her desperation
she asks her father to take her life.

604
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,560
That's awful.

605
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,600
Yes.

606
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,520
A wholly botched life.

607
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,200
Albert is a real blessing for you

608
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,000
and for our whole family.

609
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:56,680
God only knows
how long I can go on working, Lotte.

610
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:00,520
I would just like
to see you all provided fur.

611
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,040
But my heart is not in it.

612
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:12,440
You'll get over that in time.

613
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,280
Believe me.

614
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,400
It's over.
- She has rejected him.

615
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,840
Surprise, surprise.

616
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:57,400
She chose her husband after all.

617
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,920
She didn't want to flee with him
and live happily ever after.

618
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,360
It's been known to happen.

619
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,080
Other daughters have pretty mothers too.

620
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,360
Tonight we will go to the fair

621
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,200
where we will drown your sorrows

622
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,600
in our drinks.

623
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,360
<i>Want one too?</i>

624
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:31,960
Magic drops.

625
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,760
Jerusalem, what was that?
- Belladonna!

626
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:00,800
Belladonna!
- Never had anything better!

627
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,120
Ever seen so many beautiful women?

628
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,280
Never!

629
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,880
Spit at love three times!

630
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:25,120
And I will give you eternal youth.

631
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,280
Away, evil spirit!

632
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,520
I am my own hell.

633
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,640
Johann! What do you think of her?

634
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,800
I think it's serious.

635
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:18,880
You know what?

636
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,360
I love you.

637
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:38,480
This Goethe...

638
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,440
She can't forget him.

639
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,080
He's making a mockery of me.

640
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,840
What are you doing here?

641
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,040
I'm leaving.

642
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,240
Will you accompany me?

643
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,640
Leaving?

644
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,240
At this hour?

645
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,440
Come with me.

646
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:19,520
Where to?

647
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,200
Simply away from here.

648
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,120
Into the other world.

649
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,440
Where no s-sorrow torments us.

650
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,880
What? What are you talking about?

651
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:00,200
I can't live without her.
- What?

652
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,200
See you soon, my friend.

653
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,880
Entry wound at the right eye.

654
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:36,720
Exit wound
at the back of the head on the right.

655
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,040
Remained conscious.

656
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,720
Three hours of death-struggle.

657
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,760
Then death. Time of the incident?

658
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,240
The time of the incident?

659
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,920
In the morning.

660
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:59,720
It was already light.

661
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,280
Eight o'clock.

662
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,200
Diagnosis:

663
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,280
Morbus melancholicus,

664
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:15,120
leading to self-murder.

665
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:19,120
Suicide.

666
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,440
Please write "suicide."

667
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,280
Don't you know what time it is?

668
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,120
Don't you know what's happened?

669
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:51,720
Certainly.

670
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,600
This incident
caused me considerable trouble too.

671
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,600
May I

672
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,760
introduce your new colleague?
The excellent assessor

673
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,480
will fill the void
that the genteel Mr. Jerusalem

674
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,000
left in our ranks by his...

675
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,120
Never speak ill of the dead.

676
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:25,520
If one commits such an ungodly act,
one should expect to be spoken ill of,

677
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,600
don't you think?

678
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:38,840
Your very words are ungodly.

679
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,520
Your effeminate grief is ridiculous.

680
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,120
Somebody fetch a jug for the tears

681
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,240
of the young gentleman.
- Hold your tongue,

682
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,880
scoundrel!
- Please.

683
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,560
Please.

684
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,680
Such coarse language

685
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,200
from the mouth of an unsung poet.

686
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:06,320
Yet my bride was enthralled
by his sweet words:

687
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,200
"It is love

688
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,640
that holds the world together
at its cure."

689
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,320
Isn't that beautiful?

690
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,440
I demand satisfaction.

691
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:10,520
Take ten steps.
You have three shots each.

692
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:13,880
Mr. Goethe,
the first shot is yours by right.

693
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:32,320
You are under arrest
for illegal dueling.

694
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,400
A gross breach of conduct!

695
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:43,560
You should be grateful
Kestner was prudent enough not to enter

696
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,720
into the duel.

697
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:54,920
We will try to schedule your trial
at the earliest possible date.

698
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:57,320
Until that time

699
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,720
you will be kept under arrest
here at the court.

700
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:18,080
For the feast I was thinking of hare,
with a good red wine.

701
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,840
Goethe sends his regards, by the way.

702
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,040
Excuse me?

703
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,080
He's sorry he couldn't
say goodbye before his departure.

704
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,880
So, he has departed?

705
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,360
It came as a surprise to me too.

706
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,280
Thank you, my love.

707
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,760
Your meal!
- I'm coming.

708
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,760
Here, you need to eat something.

709
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,960
Women grow on trees.

710
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,160
I have...

711
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,600
I have a request to make of you.

712
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,680
I'd like some paper.

713
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:55,280
And ink.

714
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,200
<i>And thus</i>

715
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:04,480
<i>Johann saw before him...</i>

716
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:13,680
<i>And thus dear Werther saw</i>

717
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,720
before him the most charming
spectacle he had ever witnessed.

718
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,200
<i>He stood there
in his blue and yellow attire.</i>

719
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,040
<i>Children were running about...
she cut a dark bread...</i>

720
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,400
<i>beautiful appearance...
according to their ages...</i>

721
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:32,400
<i>small hands held high...
with such kindness. Each of them</i>

722
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:37,760
<i>was so unaffected... Is that impudence?
Or genuine emotional expression?</i>

723
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:42,080
<i>I don't know the man
I feared in Lotte's heart...</i>

724
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:47,760
<i>white dress... heart...
feelings... grand soul...</i>

725
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:49,920
<i>It suits you well though.
- What?</i>

726
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,720
<i>Red.</i>

727
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,680
<i>Would you care to dance?</i>

728
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,880
<i>Not interested.
- Lucky for me.</i>

729
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:00,280
<i>With her,
couldn't I express all those feelings</i>

730
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:06,560
<i>that nature instilled in my heart...
Such kindness paired with such firmness.</i>

731
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,560
<i>The soul's tranquility
when engaged in life and work.</i>

732
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,960
<i>Tasty. With thyme.</i>

733
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:22,200
<i>Good palate. - Distance
and future are much the same.</i>

734
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,680
<i>My heart was entirely at your side</i>

735
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,600
<i>and every breath was for you.</i>

736
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,640
<i>Giving our all...</i>

737
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,360
<i>Which moment?
- The one where you kiss me.</i>

738
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:37,120
<i>My heart was full...
memories of things past overcame me</i>

739
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,640
<i>and tears welled up in my eyes.</i>

740
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,360
It opens and closes.

741
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,280
This small dial shows the minutes,
the big one the hours.

742
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,880
I want a watch when I grow up.

743
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,040
Do your best at school
and I might give you one.

744
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,600
Neck size 13.

745
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:39,840
That's perfect. It's a 96.

746
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:44,280
Such wonderful cloth.
- Finest batiste.

747
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,360
From Venice.

748
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,360
Albert is really
trying to make you happy.

749
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:58,200
THE SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER

750
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:09,800
I'll get it.

751
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,400
An arm length of 70.

752
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,120
You will look like a princess.

753
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,880
This came from the court.

754
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:47,200
Lotte, the tailors are waiting.
- Nut now.

755
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,160
"So now all desires
and all hopes have been fulfilled.

756
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:56,000
That he had been blessed
with the good fortune to die for her."

757
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,200
You...

758
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:17,080
You lied to me.

759
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,640
It was...

760
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,000
It was best.

761
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:35,880
For us.

762
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,640
I must go to him.

763
01:24:55,160 --> 01:24:56,240
Certainly.

764
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:15,640
Finally!

765
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,680
Why are you doing this to me?

766
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:29,360
What? - Do you really think
I could ever be happy again,

767
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,120
if you were to harm yourself?

768
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:40,720
But without you,
dear Werther cannot live.

769
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,320
Does Werther
want to stay in the countryside

770
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,720
and get his degree?

771
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,400
And provide for Lotte's entire family?

772
01:25:55,880 --> 01:26:02,320
And keep working his way up
until he is president of the court?

773
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,040
Is that what he wants?

774
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,520
That is not Werther's life.

775
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,560
It's Albert's.

776
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,880
And Lotte's.

777
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:35,920
So she truly loves Albert?

778
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:45,960
Yes.

779
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,120
I love him.

780
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,760
And Werther?

781
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:06,240
He should make something of his talent

782
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:08,720
and not kill himself.

783
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,360
Please leave.

784
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,920
And still,
the two stay together forever.

785
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:24,440
Nut in truth.

786
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:28,880
But in poetry.

787
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:34,760
Yes.

788
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,600
Burn it.

789
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,280
Very well.

790
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,440
You may take me back now.

791
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,520
I'm back.

792
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,360
SIX MONTHS LATER

793
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,000
I wouldn't have thought it possible
for him to do something like this.

794
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:31,320
The whole thing is very embarrassing.
- The tendency for feelings

795
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:35,880
is a virus that has infected
young people everywhere.

796
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:38,560
Reason is on the retreat.

797
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,200
Old virtues are fading, Kaspar.

798
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,200
He's being detained here.

799
01:31:58,840 --> 01:31:59,760
Johann.

800
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:09,200
It was my mistake. I overestimated you.

801
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,720
I treated you like a young man,
yet you are but a child.

802
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,560
Until you come to your senses
you will stay in Frankfurt.

803
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,240
There you will work in my chambers
under strict supervision.

804
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,600
Who crammed these crazy ideas
into your head?

805
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:48,920
An early death is a pointless life.
- Leave it, Father.

806
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,640
I am my own hell.

807
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,520
Hey, make way!

808
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:37,440
Make Way!

809
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:40,680
Where are we?
- Home.

810
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:45,280
But some people are blocking the street.
- Out of the way!

811
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,000
Make Way!

812
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,640
Excuse me, what is going on here?
- Haven't you heard?

813
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,160
Have you been living under a ruck?
- He can't be from here.

814
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:22,320
You assured me. I paid you

815
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,520
three days ago.
- Please, calm down, gentlemen!

816
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:28,400
I beg of you. Please calm down.

817
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,080
The day after tomorrow...

818
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:33,920
The day after tomorrow
I will get new copies.

819
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,200
The printer has promised me.

820
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,000
<i>Maybe as soon as tomorrow.
What can I do?</i>

821
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,000
I can't print them myself.

822
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:51,160
The people
seem to like your scribblings.

823
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,200
What is that?

824
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,160
And it doesn't even rhyme.

825
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,280
THE SORROWS OF YOUNG WERTHER

826
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:12,440
Lotte?

827
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:15,960
Shit!

828
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:22,720
You would've made
a wretched lawyer anyway.

829
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,240
That's him! It's Johann Goethe!

830
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:40,160
I know him from university. Goethe,

831
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:41,960
with an "oe"!

832
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,720
Thank you. Thank you.
Get your head out.

833
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,080
Our Goethe.
- He simply writes

834
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:11,560
the must banal of stories.
- Boy loves girl.

835
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,960
Girl marries another.
- Boy blows his brains out.

836
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,480
Here's to passion.
- To "Sturm"... - And drink!

837
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:36,360
I think he is expected. Go on!

838
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:38,960
Get out there!

839
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,160
That's my sun!

840
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:05,160
My sun.

841
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:07,720
Johann Goethe.

842
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,880
It's our story.

843
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:39,640
It would be an honor to publish it.

844
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,880
I have one last question.

845
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:52,600
Is this really what happened?

846
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:56,680
Is it all true?

847
01:37:57,080 --> 01:37:59,840
It is more than truth.

848
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,040
It is poetry.

849
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:20,560
<i>The Sorrows of Young Werther made
23-year-old Goethe famous across Europe.</i>

850
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:28,440
Werther's story sparked off a youth
movement and led to a wave of suicides.

851
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:36,800
Lotte bore Kestner many children.
She saw Johann only one more time.
