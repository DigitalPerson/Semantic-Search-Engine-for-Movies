1
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:38,062
The Thakur...?
- Welcome, sir. This way...

2
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:28,434
I knew it the moment I received
your letter, Thakur...

3
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,561
that you wished to meet me.
I took the first available train.

4
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,440
I'm putting you to
some trouble, jailer.

5
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,637
Not at all, sir. Just name it...
whatever it be.

6
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,242
I need two men.
- Two?

7
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,764
Do you recognise them?

8
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:04,198
There's hardly a prison where
they have not been held, Thakur.

9
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,096
This is Veeru.
And this is Jai.

10
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:13,303
They're crooks, both of them.
Thieves of the first order.

11
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,708
I know.

12
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,719
They're just what I need
for the assignment at hand.

13
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:27,115
I can't say what assignment
you have in mind, Thakur.

14
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,752
But I can surely tell you that
they're good for nothing.

15
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,322
That's not true, jailer.

16
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,066
For all their vices, they
have some virtues, too.

17
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,874
A fake coin is a fake, sir.
Whichever way you look at it.

18
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:48,004
That is perhaps the difference
between man and coin.

19
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:54,210
I clearly remember what
happened two years ago.

20
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,919
I had arrested both of them
in district Jamalpur.

21
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,922
We had to reach the police station
at village Tamli by dusk.

22
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,363
Since no other arrangements
could be made...

23
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,936
we took a goods-train.

24
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,940
I had two constables with me.
And there were these crooks...

25
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:19,407
Jaidev and Veeru;
chained and handcuffed.

26
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,271
Could you have been at the
Daulatpur police station earlier, sir?

27
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,715
Yes, I was. Why did you ask?

28
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,255
I remember now!

29
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,920
I've been wondering where I've
seen you, ever since you've caught us.

30
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,023
Remember Lalji's shop? The
provision store which we robbed?

31
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,697
Do you remember?
- The provision store? No...

32
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,970
Don't you? Jai...

33
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,398
Remember, we were held at
the Daulatpur police station?

34
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,066
Daulatpur?
- Yes, don't you remember?

35
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:55,313
When was that?
- We had robbed the grocer...

36
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:59,748
He was the officer then...
Don't you recognise him?

37
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,779
All police officers
look the same to me.

38
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,319
I can't help it, you know...
He's always talking nonsense.

39
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,958
Since when have the two of you
been in this racket?

40
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:20,131
You could say, we stood our own
two feet, the moment we could!

41
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,270
But why must you do all this?

42
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,342
The reason what you're a cop for...
we into it for the money.

43
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:30,339
Not true. I'm not a police officer
just for the money.

44
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,276
I have enough of family land
to keep us going.

45
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:39,051
But perhaps I'm fond of the
dangers involved in the game.

46
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,356
We face dangers everyday, too.

47
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:47,958
There's a difference. I take on
dangers to protect the law.

48
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,063
And you do it to
break the law.

49
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:55,205
You need to be a brave man,
in both the cases.

50
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,940
Oh sure! You do need courage.

51
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,811
I see.

52
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,074
You guys think you're
very brave, don't you?

53
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:06,446
You will see when
the need arises, Inspector.

54
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,477
We'd atleast take on
15 or 20 guys.

55
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,322
I haven't exaggerated it,
have I?

56
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,358
Now that you've already said it...
- We deal with it!

57
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:28,134
Bandits!

58
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,416
Well, Inspector?
Want to try out our guts?

59
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,298
There's still time, Inspector.
Give it a thought!

60
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,001
Don't you try to escape.

61
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,680
Stop the engine, driver!

62
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,593
Let's move ahead!
As fast as you can!

63
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,748
Charge ahead!

64
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,025
Give me a swig! Quick!

65
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,912
Are you okay?
- I'm all right...

66
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,413
He dares mess with Veeru!

67
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:01,157
They've fled, the swines!

68
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,585
Let's go... come on!

69
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,561
I had warned you
not to escape...

70
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,942
What do you think?
- We can run away.

71
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,707
Leaving him in this state?

72
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,645
He's going to die, if we
leave him in this condition.

73
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,747
Suppose we take him
to the hospital...

74
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,256
we get sent away for
four or six months.

75
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,885
So what do you suggest?
- What do you think?

76
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,999
Get it out.

77
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:48,071
If it's Heads, we go to the hospital;
if it's Tails, we escape.

78
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,879
They are criminals, no doubt.
But they're terribly brave.

79
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:05,820
They're dangerous, because
they know how to fight back.

80
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,019
They're bad... but they're human.

81
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:16,597
Could you find these
guys for me, jailer?

82
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,764
We'll easily find them, if they
are presently in some prison.

83
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:26,342
But if they're free, it's
difficult to find such people.

84
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:20,229
We Will Not Break This Friendship

85
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:29,699
I May Break My Strength,
But I Will Not Leave Your Side

86
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:17,623
Oh, My Victory Is Your Victory,
Your Loss Is My Loss

87
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,956
Listen, Oh My Friend

88
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:26,096
Your Pain Is My Pain,
My Life Is Your Life

89
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:30,429
That Is How Our Love Is

90
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:37,499
I Will Even Risk My Life,
For You I Will

91
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:48,145
Become Enemies With Everyone

92
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:05,324
People See Two Of Us, But

93
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,158
Look, We Are Not Two

94
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:13,899
Oh, That We Be Separated Or Angry,
Oh God I Pray

95
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,562
That This May Not Happen

96
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,828
We Will Eat And Drink Together

97
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,439
We Will Die And Live Together

98
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:34,050
For Our Entire Lives

99
00:23:58,036 --> 00:24:00,300
Soorma Bhopali! You're pulling
out more of the firewood.

100
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:03,338
Naturally. You don't expect me
to put some more, do you?

101
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:07,308
The scale says it's enough...
and you insist on more.

102
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,114
Just take the wood and get going.
Give me the money...

103
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,314
Here's a 2-Rupee bill.

104
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:16,178
I can see that, but is it genuine?
Okay, it is.

105
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,957
So then, good-bye.

106
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:25,087
Won't you return my money?
- Money? What money do you want?

107
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,228
That's a 2-Rupee bill!
- The wood is worth 2 Rupees too!

108
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,297
Just this much of wood
for two Rupees?!

109
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:34,201
Were you out to buy the whole forest
for two bucks then?

110
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,307
Now look; I've had enough!
Just get going.

111
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,478
I'm not Soorma Bhopali for nothing!
Okay?

112
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:46,581
Get lost...
I wonder where they come from!

113
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:50,486
He says the wood is too little!
Wants the forest then, does he?!

114
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:53,247
They always come early every
morning to spoil my day!

115
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:59,187
There, chand! You're at your
cursed poetry again!

116
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:02,261
Go and check if they're unloaded
the stuff from the truck yet!

117
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,625
Well! Well! Are you guys
watching a drama here?

118
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:09,772
This is no travellers' bungalow...
who are you guys?

119
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,508
God Almighty! It's you!

120
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:22,048
How are you, Soorma Bhopali?
- I'm fine, thank you!

121
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,150
But what are you guys up to?!

122
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,190
Come here!

123
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:32,226
The police have declared a reward
of 2000 Rupees for your arrest.

124
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,658
If someone watches us together...

125
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:39,162
I'll land in trouble, too!
So please get going!

126
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,440
Know what, Soorma Bhopali?
We want to go to prison.

127
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:45,037
I hope God fulfills your wish!

128
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:49,106
Had this been Bhopal, I'd have had
you locked up in just two minutes!

129
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,346
I'm not Soorma Bhopali for
nothing, you know!

130
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,380
But why would anyone
need me here?

131
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,483
A warrant's out in
your name in any case!

132
00:25:57,822 --> 00:26:01,349
But we want you to
have us arrested.

133
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,625
What are you talking about?!

134
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,559
There's a reward of 2000 Rupees
which you will get.

135
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:13,796
Give us half the money, when
we're released from prison.

136
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,267
Do you get it?
- What are you saying!

137
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:23,410
Have some betel-leaf;
Go on... it's great!

138
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,352
Since when have they started
having a parade here?

139
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:38,223
You've just arrived, sonny boy.
You'll get to know soon.

140
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:40,554
This new jailor is a nasty one!

141
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,698
A nasty jailor, he says.
- There he is.

142
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,183
Attention, I say!

143
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,753
But they're already
at attention, sir.

144
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,461
I know that.

145
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,297
Prisoners!
This is a warning for you!

146
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,302
Everything that went unchecked
before my arrival here...

147
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,670
will no longer be tolerated!

148
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:37,347
I've been a jailor since
the British days!

149
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:40,284
I don't belong to the breed
of jailors...

150
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,393
who waste time, trying to
reform the prisoners!

151
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,596
I know it for a fact!
You guys can't be reformed!

152
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:54,232
How can you ever change,
when I have not changed?

153
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:03,375
I know, my words don't
go down well with you.

154
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:09,245
Which is why I am transferred
from every place I work in.

155
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:16,819
But despite all my transfers...
I have not changed!

156
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,297
So you'd better remember!

157
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:25,627
Don't think I am not informed
of all that you guys are up to!

158
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:32,241
I have spies everywhere
in the prison.

159
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,606
I get a report of every moment.

160
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:41,548
Not even a bird could flap its
wings here without my consent!

161
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,521
What the hell was that?!
- A bird... a pigeon, sir!

162
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,284
What's that in my eyes...
never mind!

163
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:52,763
This will do for today!
You may leave now.

164
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,329
Let's go!

165
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,338
Strange guy!

166
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,002
Who could be the jailor's spy?

167
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:10,239
I know that.
It's the barber, Hariram.

168
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:14,310
He's very thick with the jailor.
The swine!

169
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,445
Hariram, the barber?

170
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,388
Go ahead and shave
my moustache, Hariram.

171
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,830
It has all been arranged!

172
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,926
We get cracking tomorrow.

173
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:37,664
How many days will it take
to make the tunnel?

174
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,874
You've cut my face!

175
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:45,040
The tunnel? It should be
ready in about a week.

176
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,751
Where are we going to
dig the tunnel from?

177
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,321
It's from Barrack No. 9.

178
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,316
I hope the jailor
doesn't get to know!

179
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,528
No one will hear of it!

180
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,596
Let's go!

181
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:08,469
There. I'm through.

182
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:19,949
Yes, Hariram?
What news do you bring?

183
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,678
Be careful, sir. They're digging
a tunnel in the jail.

184
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,815
Oh, well! A tunnel in my jail...

185
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,953
What was that? A tunnel
in my jail?!

186
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:34,030
Yes, sir. The prisoners are
making a tunnel in the jail.

187
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,364
I've been a jailor since
the days of the British!

188
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,864
A tunnel in my jail, eh?

189
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:12,726
So this is where the
tunnel is being dug!

190
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,670
This is wonderful!

191
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:19,704
But you guys seem to have
forgotten that my spies...

192
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,604
are spread out in
every part of the prison.

193
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,441
And what is this?

194
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,887
So this is the tool with which
you will dig the tunnel!

195
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:43,996
I'm a jailor... from
the British days!

196
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,101
Here he comes!

197
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:59,115
Is it all arranged then?
- Yes.

198
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,150
We won't miss out this time!

199
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,082
A pistol has arrived
in the prison!

200
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,720
Has the pistol arrived?!

201
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:17,001
In just a couple of days,
the jailor and his spies...

202
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,067
A pistol in my prison, eh?

203
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,914
A pistol in my prison,
did you say?!

204
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,777
A revolt?!
- That's right.

205
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:33,881
Streams of blood?!
- Exactly.

206
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,788
Halt!

207
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:48,163
Search every nook and corner
of the jail!

208
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,495
Half of you go in that direction.

209
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,935
Half of you go there.

210
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:00,977
The rest of you guys...
come with me!

211
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:12,572
Here's the pistol!

212
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:16,710
Move an inch, and...

213
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,350
Guards!
- They've left.

214
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,063
Let's go to your office.
- How can I?

215
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,295
You have asked me not to move!

216
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:32,231
The first order stands cancelled.
Let's go.

217
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:47,481
Is the jailor of the British days
so scared?

218
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,211
No!

219
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:55,390
Come and see us off
at the gate first!

220
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,369
Have the gate opened.

221
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,318
Open the gate.

222
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,134
Here's the key.

223
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,595
And here's the "pistol"!

224
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,843
The two of them must have
tried to run away, isn't it?

225
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,613
Tried to run away?
That's an understatement!

226
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:56,444
They put their lives into it!
But I wasn't about to let them go!

227
00:35:56,921 --> 00:36:01,153
As I held one of them,
the other tried to escape.

228
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:05,292
I dragged him back and asked,
"Where to, feller?"

229
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,723
With two stinging slaps, I ordered
them to the police station!

230
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,700
That was it! They were
begging at my feet!

231
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,361
Did Veeru and Jai really
beg at your feet?

232
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,735
They're dangerous criminals!
- They're criminals, all right!

233
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,442
But I'm not called Soorma
Bhopali for nothing!

234
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,714
You can imagine!
They wept at my feet!

235
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,776
And begged for forgiveness;
I'd have forgiven them, too!

236
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:35,792
But I was furious that they had
dared to trespass my territory!

237
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,285
What happened next?
- What else?!

238
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,431
You know I carry a stick!

239
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:43,923
It was days since I had used it.
So I got down to brass-tracks...

240
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,167
and I really thrashed them!
I gave them a terrible beating!

241
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,464
What happened next?
- What would have happened?

242
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:55,303
I held them by their collars
and said...

243
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,714
What did you say?
- What did I?!

244
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:00,251
What did I say?!
Yes, I remember...

245
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,914
I said, "Do let me know if there is
something more I can do for you"

246
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:08,523
Well, guys... have you
nothing better to do?

247
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:12,421
You plonk yourselves here and
compel me to concoct falsehoods!

248
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,566
Go and attend to your work!
Go on... lazy bums!

249
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,394
Well... I was only kidding.

250
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:25,799
But you guys have been released
pretty quickly, haven't you?

251
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:31,679
My word! The stint at the prison
seems to have been good for you!

252
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:36,248
We are here to collect
our thousand Rupees.

253
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,787
A thousand rupees?
- That's right. A thousand bucks.

254
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,787
I see!

255
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,727
I got the money the very next day
of your arrest!

256
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:51,401
Since that day, the money has been
lying in an envelope in my pocket!

257
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,662
Check it out...
it's a thousand bucks!

258
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,598
Well, Soorma... see you again.

259
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,015
It's these chaps I've
been looking for.

260
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,787
When does their prison term
come to an end?

261
00:38:15,826 --> 00:38:17,817
On the 18th of the next month.

262
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,461
Could I have a beedi, guard?

263
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:46,752
Well, Inspector? Whom have you
brought to the prison today?

264
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,691
I'm not an Inspector anymore.
I'm just Thakur Baldev Singh.

265
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:57,691
Why? Have you gotten over your
fondness of playing with dangers?

266
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,371
If your bravery really makes
you so arrogant...

267
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,867
will you accept
an assignment from me?

268
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:10,611
We accept assignments
only for money.

269
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:13,607
How much do you want?

270
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,555
What's the job?

271
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:23,389
Why must you worry about that,
if you're really brave?

272
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:27,395
Name the price.
And you will get it.

273
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,730
Provided you do what
I want you to do.

274
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,738
Gabbar Singh?!
The notorious bandit?!

275
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,930
Yes. He's the one.

276
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,808
The police are even said to have
placed a reward on his head.

277
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:45,174
50,000 Rupees... for capturing him
dead or alive.

278
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:50,181
You've got to capture the
bandit for me... alive.

279
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,124
You want us to get Gabbar Singh...
that too, alive and kicking!

280
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,661
Gabbar Singh is no sheep-kid
we could run and catch, Thakur!

281
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:02,125
I know it's a difficult task.

282
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:05,762
But no one pays so much
for something easy.

283
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:10,435
Let's suppose we risk our lives and
somehow manage to capture him.

284
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:14,208
Do you want us to hand him over
to you for just 20,000 Rupees?

285
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:16,807
So you can make a cool
50,000 Rupees, for nothing?

286
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,149
The reward from the police
will go to you, too.

287
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,576
I only want Gabbar.

288
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,946
Is it an old feud?

289
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,120
That's none of your business.

290
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,461
May I ask you another
question then?

291
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,894
You know we're criminals, too.

292
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:45,772
Why did you choose us
to track down the bandit?

293
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:50,239
Only because iron
shall deal with iron.

294
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,988
That's 5,000 Rupees.

295
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,918
You will get 5,000 more upon
your arrival in Ramgarh.

296
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,620
The rest after you have
accomplished the mission.

297
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,936
What do you suggest?

298
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,510
"Heads" -we go.

299
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,539
Well, gentlemen?
Where will you go?

300
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,800
Belapur, Rampur, Ramgarh...
where do you want to go?

301
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:57,806
Have you never seen
a horse-cart before?

302
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,709
This is a village, sir.

303
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:03,683
You can't find cars here in
which you can speed away.

304
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,079
Basanti's "tonga" is all
you will find around here.

305
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,020
Now look; I'm not in the habit
of talking unnecessarily.

306
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:12,126
Say so, if you wish to go...
- Well, we do wish...

307
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:16,163
It's okay, if you don't wish to go!
You won't be my enemies!

308
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,567
I thought you'd need a tonga
and happened to ask you.

309
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,065
But you don't have to be
my passengers, you know.

310
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,240
It's your own free will!

311
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,745
This is Basanti's tonga, not
the field of the landlord...

312
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,770
which you will have to till,
even if you don't want to!

313
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,809
This is just like...
- Let's go! We wish to go!

314
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,043
Let's go!
- Sure. When have I refused?

315
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,586
Now look; I'm not a chatter-box.

316
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,257
So I'd better tell you in advance.

317
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,093
A ride to Belapur costs 2 Rupees
and one to Rampur costs 1.5 Rupee.

318
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:49,628
Don't haggle, please!
What Basanti says is final!

319
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,832
Okay, but we...
- I know what you will say!

320
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:56,766
Just why I charge 2 Rupees for
Belapur and 1.50 for Ramgarh?

321
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,603
You'd better ask which village
this tonga belongs to. Go on.

322
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:04,014
Well, where does it belong?
- It belongs to Ramgarh!

323
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:07,342
I see! So it belongs
to Ramgarh! Now I know!

324
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,315
Actually, there is this thing
worth considering.

325
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,721
When I make a trip to Belapur,
I actually make two trips.

326
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,652
To Belapur and back to Ramgarh.

327
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:20,658
But should I go to Ramgarh,
it's like going home.

328
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:24,827
Where would you like to go?

329
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,360
Actually, we'd like
to go to Ramgarh, too.

330
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,932
Sure! When have I refused?

331
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,972
But you will have to tell me
whose house you're going to.

332
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,675
So Basanti can take you
to that house.

333
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,415
If l'm not told where
you've got to go...

334
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,819
how will I stop the tonga?

335
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,720
How will the tonga stop
if l don't stop it?

336
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:49,882
Who holds the reins?
I do!

337
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,391
And if l...

338
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,425
We've got to go to Thakur
Baldev Singh's place.

339
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,398
Sure! Let's go!
When did I refuse?

340
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,666
You could said as much!

341
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,735
Let's go, Dhanno!

342
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:14,942
So you see, I had already
lost my parents.

343
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:19,254
And who had to fend for my aunt
and ply the tonga?

344
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,392
Me, of course.

345
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:26,762
People ask how a girl like me
can go around plying a tonga.

346
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:29,756
I have an answer ready
for them.

347
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,900
Dhanno is a mare; and she
can still draw the cart.

348
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,003
So why not Basanti?
Am I right?

349
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:41,005
So what's wrong? City girls drive
cars... no one says anything to them.

350
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:45,204
You're a wise man, although
you're from the city.

351
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:48,115
What is your name?
- Veeru.

352
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,477
You haven't yet asked me
my name, have you?

353
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,855
What is your name, Basanti?

354
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,924
Oh, shut up! You're always
talking nonsense!

355
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:59,854
I wasn't talking to you, you know.

356
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,427
But since you have asked me,
let me tell you...

357
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:05,234
my name is Basanti.

358
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,030
That's the first time
I've heard the name.

359
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:11,069
Basanti! What a lovely name!

360
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:15,471
There's a story
behind my name, too.

361
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:17,844
Really? Do tell me...!

362
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:20,880
When I was a little girl...

363
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:24,211
a distant relative said...

364
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,300
That's it, Dhanno! Halt!

365
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:46,069
This is the Thakur's mansion.

366
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:51,113
Strange! Talking to you guys,
I didn't even realise the distance.

367
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,306
That's right.
We are very talkative.

368
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,984
Here's the 1.50 Rupee
we had settled for.

369
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:59,550
You're a nice man. I shouldn't be
accepting the money from you.

370
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:03,184
But what will the horse eat,
if it befriends its food?

371
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:07,156
So I will accept the money.
- That's very kind of you.

372
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,492
Let's go, Dhanno!

373
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:23,071
Wow! She talks so well!

374
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,074
She talks too much!

375
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,941
Let's go. You don't have to
score with every girl you meet.

376
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:30,381
Come on!

377
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,924
Welcome.

378
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,489
This way, please.

379
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:46,332
Greetings, Thakur.

380
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,538
You had no problems
getting here, I hope?

381
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:52,175
Well, not much.
- Come in.

382
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:58,605
Had you dropped a letter, I'd have
sent someone to receive you.

383
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,550
Your stay has been arranged.

384
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,853
Just let me know, if there
is anything you need.

385
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:19,130
I had promised to pay you 5000
rupees on your arrival here.

386
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:26,902
You remember your
assignment, don't you?

387
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,336
I want Gabbar.

388
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,109
I want him alive.
- Of course, remember.

389
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:37,385
You want Gabbar...
captured alive.

390
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:39,411
You will have him.

391
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:43,324
Go and take some rest.
You must be tired.

392
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,094
We'll discuss the rest later.

393
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:47,920
Follow me.

394
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,277
Please go ahead.
I'll go and fetch the keys.

395
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:15,050
That safe was
stuffed with riches!

396
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,955
Folks in this village
seem to wear a lot of gold.

397
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,254
So what do you say?

398
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:49,357
Quite a big house...
and beautiful, too.

399
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:54,459
Who else stays in there?
- Your keys.

400
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,625
That is your quarters.

401
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,060
Do call me over, should
you need something.

402
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,274
I can't quite figure this out.

403
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:11,445
Why must we bother, Jai?
The Thakur has paid us 10,000.

404
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:15,378
Let's clean out his safe tonight
and get away. What say?

405
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:17,915
Very well.

406
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,884
Let's sleep now, if we're going
to keep awake tonight.

407
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:02,852
Thakur! These guys were...
- They're my men.

408
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:06,020
Then why did they attack us?

409
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:11,967
I wanted to see if you still
possess the courage and strength.

410
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:17,833
Or whether time has rendered
your might, impotent.

411
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,300
So? What did you see?

412
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:29,417
I see that I have made no mistake
in having you brought here.

413
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,985
There is one mistake you
have made, Thakur!

414
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,324
You have shown us the
contents of your safe.

415
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:04,737
Here's the key to the safe.

416
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,918
The safe has some ornaments
which are of no use to me.

417
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,054
A widow will never need them
again.

418
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:20,930
It has some money, too.
You can take that away.

419
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,659
I'm glad, it will atleast break
the Thakur's false hopes.

420
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:29,766
Hopes, that he has pinned on you.

421
00:53:42,919 --> 00:53:43,908
Excuse me.

422
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,168
That which happened last night
will not happen again.

423
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,901
Here... have some more!

424
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,260
You've eaten enough
to be big and strong!

425
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:38,103
But when we make to trip to Belapur,
you sure do put on airs!

426
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:42,234
Go ahead and eat...!
- Basanti...!

427
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,544
I'm here, feeding
this donkey, aunty!

428
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:48,212
Now watch her take off!

429
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:52,786
Listen, lady!
You can roam around all day!

430
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:55,886
But you wouldn't do
a simple chore for me!

431
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:57,955
There she is! Ranting as usual!

432
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,586
You're always losing
your temper with me, aunty.

433
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:03,992
Won't you give me a chance?
What had you asked me to do?

434
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,997
You asked me to go to
the physician, didn't you?

435
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,033
I did go to him to
fetch your medicines.

436
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:13,139
But he wasn't there.
He's supposed to be ill...

437
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,868
and has gone to the neigbouring
village for treatment.

438
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:19,846
I didn't mention the doctor and
you gave me a whole lecture!

439
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,208
What else did you ask me to do?

440
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,847
Didn't I ask you to fetch some
raw mangoes for the pickle?

441
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:26,920
But you will never remember!

442
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:30,988
Oh sure, you did tell me!
I'll go and fetch them right away!

443
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,899
Imam Saheb! Do you want me
to reach you home?

444
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,234
Who's that?

445
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,966
Basanti! It's you today.

446
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:46,968
I've spent years in this village.
You weren't even born then.

447
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:51,638
But even before I can alight
the steps of the mosque...

448
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,582
there is someone
to reach me home.

449
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:56,681
Why wouldn't anyone?

450
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:59,218
There's not a soul in town
who does not respect you.

451
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,317
When they respect you so much,
why won't they help you too?

452
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:05,352
It's all very natural.
Actually...

453
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:09,162
When you can talk so much, why don't
you talk some sense to Ahmed too?

454
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:11,768
He's even younger to you.

455
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:14,828
I know how to make them
see sense, lmam.

456
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,005
I can make your son
see reason too.

457
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:23,339
But unless I know what I have
to talk about, how will I?

458
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,246
Ahmed's uncle works for a beedi-
manufacturing factory in Jabalpur.

459
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:31,218
He earns 300 Rupees every month!
- Really?

460
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:34,688
He has written to me so very often
to send Ahmed over...

461
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,620
so he'll talk to his boss and
find Ahmed a job in the same factory.

462
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,086
But Ahmed is just not
prepared to go!

463
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,755
He says I'd be left all alone!

464
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,167
Hi! How are you?
- I'm fine, all right.

465
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:50,635
Now tell me; you've completed your
matriculation and speak English too.

466
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,235
And as your uncle
in Jabalpur writes...

467
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:56,173
There you are! You're taken up
with my father says, too!

468
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,176
That's the only thing he says
to anyone who meets him.

469
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:00,373
So what's wrong? I just answered
a question she asked.

470
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:03,753
You know, I'm not used
to talking without reason.

471
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,956
But just think it over!
It's a beedi-manufacturing factory!

472
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:09,925
Work while you work... and smoke
a beedi, when you feel like it!

473
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:13,358
It's like getting all the
mangoes for nothing...

474
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,296
My God!
- What's wrong?

475
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,767
The mangoes! I forgot them again!

476
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:21,831
The raw-mangoes!
- The raw mangoes?

477
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:24,336
Yes. I had to fetch them
for the pickle...

478
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,954
Well? What are you doing here?

479
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:51,892
Well...! That's how it is.

480
00:57:53,002 --> 00:57:54,993
Well... which mango do you
want me to knock off?

481
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,968
Can you really shoot down
the mango I want?

482
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,134
That's child's play!

483
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:02,970
The best of the big shots pay
respects at my meet...

484
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,239
and swear they haven't seen
a marksman like me!

485
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,317
You seem to be a damn good-shot!

486
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,453
Sure... he's of royal
descent, isn't he?

487
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,988
What was that he said?
- Never mind. He talks nonsense.

488
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,223
So, which mango do you want?

489
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:23,098
That one there... the other one,
too. And yet another one there.

490
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:38,140
My word! Your friend
is a great shot, too!

491
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,248
Eh? Oh, yes. Bright chap, you know.

492
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,884
I'm still teaching him...
He'll learn soon.

493
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:46,246
Can you teach me, too?
- Certainly! I can teach you, too!

494
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:49,117
In fact, I can teach you this
in a matter of two days.

495
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:51,417
In just two days?!
- Of course.

496
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:54,353
There have been people he has
"taught" in a couple of hours!

497
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,502
In just a couple of hours!
- He talks nonsense, you know!

498
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:04,030
Well, come with me, if you
wish to learn this.

499
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:07,132
Can you see that mango there?

500
00:59:07,477 --> 00:59:08,967
You can see it, can't you?
- Sure.

501
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,270
Now hold the gun...

502
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:17,115
and bring this other hand...
close to the other.

503
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:21,251
Now place this finger
on the trigger.

504
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:23,983
Now close your eye and...

505
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,524
I have already shut my eyes!

506
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:31,831
What is he talking about?
- The usual nonsense!

507
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,497
Now close your eyes.
- Very well.

508
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:39,139
Now... can you see that mango?

509
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:44,570
Strange! How can I see the mango,
when I've shut my eyes?

510
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:47,139
Have you shut both your eyes?!
- Yes.

511
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:50,443
But you must shut only
your left eye... this one!

512
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,578
Now use your other eye
to aim at the mango.

513
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:57,187
Okay. And what do I do now?
- Now? Well...

514
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,485
Now squeeze the trigger!

515
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,230
He's found his mark!

516
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:11,235
I thought I was learning
to handle a gun.

517
01:00:11,908 --> 01:00:14,342
But now I smell a rat!

518
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:18,070
A rat? What is that?
I don't understand!

519
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:20,073
But I understand this
perfectly well!

520
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:24,582
You city-guys think we in the
countryside are morons!

521
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:31,024
But Basanti could very well
teach you a lesson!

522
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:35,287
I was only teaching you!
You're misunderstanding me!

523
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:38,259
I understand you very well!

524
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:41,867
Sit here with your gun!
I'm going home!

525
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,469
Good-bye!

526
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:32,703
Kashiram! Dholiya!
Where the hell are all of you?

527
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:42,649
Come, Shankar...
what have you brought?

528
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:45,486
It's some jowar, sir.

529
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:49,883
Bloody fiend! You give us
a handful of jowar?

530
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,558
Did you want to feed the guests at
your daughter's wedding with the rest?

531
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:56,663
I speak the truth, sir!
I've brought all I had!

532
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:02,630
We need just one bullet
to blow your brains out!

533
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,939
The stinking bastard!

534
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,847
And what have you got, Dholiya?
- It's wheat, sir.

535
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:15,816
Very well. Keep all the stuff there.

536
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,744
Hold it.

537
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:23,917
Welcome, Thakur!
You're still alive, are you?

538
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:28,962
Yes. And till such time
as I live...

539
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:33,566
tell Gabbar you won't even
get a grain from this village.

540
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:36,834
And who's going to stop us? You?

541
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:42,007
Yes. My men and I will.

542
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,309
These men?

543
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:51,077
Heard that, guys? The Thakur has
built an army of eunuchs!

544
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:55,682
Death hovers over
your head, Kalia!

545
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:58,556
Just look around!

546
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:16,942
Two of them? Is that all?

547
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,405
That's enough for you.

548
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:23,381
Kashiram... have all
the things taken back.

549
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:28,623
Think it over, Thakur.
When Gabbar gets to know...

550
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:32,050
that people of this village
refuse to give him food grains...

551
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:36,563
there can be a lot of bloodshed.
Why must you simply...

552
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:49,841
Get lost!
And tell Gabbar...

553
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:55,014
that the people of Ramgarh
have stopped feeding mad dogs!

554
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,119
Go away!

555
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:01,781
All right, Thakur!
I will go away!

556
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,767
How many were they?

557
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:58,010
There were two of them, chief.

558
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,852
Two of them?

559
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,852
Goddamned bastards!

560
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:18,231
There were just two of them...
and there were three of you.

561
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,161
You have still returned...

562
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,900
without anything.

563
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,737
What did you expect?

564
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:34,947
That I'd be delighted?!

565
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:37,982
That I'd congratulate you?!

566
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,519
Shame on you!

567
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,564
Samba!

568
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,724
What prize has the Government
placed on my head?

569
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:56,004
Fifty thousand Rupees, no less.
- Did you hear him?

570
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:00,503
Fifty grand!

571
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:04,836
And that's only because...

572
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:10,081
when children as many as
50 miles away from here...

573
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,778
when the babies are hollering
away in the nights...

574
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:18,086
their mother ask them to go to
sleep, lest Gabbar Singh arrives!

575
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:25,761
And these bastards! They've done
my reputation to dust!

576
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:33,007
You will be punished.
You certainly will!

577
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:42,908
How many bullets does
this gun have?

578
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:45,720
How many bullets in this?
- There are six, chief.

579
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:49,114
Six bullets.

580
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:53,852
This gun has six bullets.

581
01:08:56,298 --> 01:09:00,234
Six bullets... for just 3 men.

582
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,134
That's an injustice!

583
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:13,674
It's okay now... it certainly is.

584
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:20,578
Three parts of this now hold
bullets; and three are empty.

585
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:24,716
I'll just roll the
whole stuff over.

586
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:34,031
I don't know now where the bullets
are, or where they are not.

587
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,895
I know nothing!

588
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:49,716
This gun now holds three lives
and three deaths.

589
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,880
Let's see what they get.

590
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:04,189
He's escaped!

591
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:23,008
He's escaped, too!

592
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:34,594
What's gonna happen
of you, Kaliya?

593
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:38,229
Chief! I've always lived
on what I got from you!

594
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:44,262
It's time you stopped a bullet.

595
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:54,039
This is amazing!

596
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,287
All three have escaped!

597
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:13,365
None of the bastards
stopped a bullet!

598
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:42,226
All three have escaped!

599
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:25,406
Death to the cowards!

600
01:12:37,486 --> 01:12:40,322
When is the festival of colours?
When is Holi?

601
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:50,727
Let come a friend

602
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:55,003
Let come a partner

603
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:03,411
Catch her

604
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,542
Don't leave her

605
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:07,949
Don't break my hand

606
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:12,315
Oh stop sister in law
- Go away Drinker

607
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,622
What happen Raja?
- Come in street

608
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:19,123
Holi oh Holi
- Villager's bueaty... - Oh naughty

609
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:23,497
I will give you bad words
- Raamu's sister in law...

610
01:13:53,228 --> 01:14:03,194
On the festivals of Holi
our hearts are blooming and
all the colours merge into each other

611
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:20,015
Forget all problems &
hug friends and enemies

612
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:20,671
I will make colour
like your colour

613
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:29,354
Let me steal colour from
your pink chicks

614
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:33,258
Go away you crazy

615
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:42,036
Don't tease me you shameless

616
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:51,170
Ask the world on such occasions only,
the hearts get exchanged

617
01:21:47,636 --> 01:21:52,073
Well... so this is the
Thakur's soldier!

618
01:21:55,944 --> 01:22:00,278
Kaliya told us there
were two of them, Samba.

619
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:03,881
Where is the other?

620
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:06,314
Where are you, soldier?!

621
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:12,649
Hey, soldier... where
is your partner?

622
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:14,788
Speak up!

623
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:16,894
Listen, you other soldier!

624
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:20,758
Will you step out, or do
I gun down your friend here?

625
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:22,728
Hold it!

626
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:30,675
Welcome...! Welcome!

627
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:35,112
We now have you in
our clutches!

628
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,420
Welcome...

629
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:43,750
Good-boy!

630
01:22:58,373 --> 01:23:04,039
Well, Thakur? You brought these
guys to protect Ramgarh, did you?

631
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:07,247
To take on Gabbar, did you?

632
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:12,717
Listen, you villagers!
Take a look out here!

633
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:16,922
These the guys who came here
to protect you from me!

634
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:22,122
Have they lost your pluck?
All of it?!

635
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:31,770
There's only one man who can
save you from Gabbar's wrath!

636
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:34,899
And that's Gabbar himself!

637
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:41,476
In exchange for your security, if
we take some provisions from you...

638
01:23:41,883 --> 01:23:43,908
that is no crime or injustice!

639
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:47,947
No crime, I say!
It's no injustice!

640
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:56,390
That's it then! Should anyone
dare raise his head again...

641
01:23:56,965 --> 01:23:58,455
I will...

642
01:24:03,104 --> 01:24:05,470
The heads!

643
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:10,302
You think these guys are
accomplished fighters, don't you?

644
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:13,414
These hired-gunmen will now...

645
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:20,219
place their heads on my feet
and beg for mercy!

646
01:24:22,023 --> 01:24:24,048
They will beg at my feet!

647
01:24:29,097 --> 01:24:32,157
You've heard me, haven't you?
You have?

648
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:38,904
Those heads of yours...
at my feet!

649
01:24:40,809 --> 01:24:42,071
Come on.

650
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,805
Move, I say!

651
01:25:18,413 --> 01:25:19,903
Hurry up, Dhanno!

652
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:13,521
We can't wage this battle
for you anymore, Thakur!

653
01:27:14,596 --> 01:27:18,532
We held you in great respect.
But it's all over!

654
01:27:19,601 --> 01:27:22,195
We came here for
the brave inspector...

655
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:26,071
who waged a lone battle against
a gang of bandits in the train.

656
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:27,308
We didn't come here
for a coward...

657
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:28,866
We didn't come here
for a coward...

658
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:32,638
who couldn't pick up a gun lying
before him to save our lives!

659
01:27:35,016 --> 01:27:38,076
It's okay, if you wish to leave.

660
01:27:39,153 --> 01:27:40,814
You can go.

661
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:46,551
Before you leave, won't you
want to know the reason...

662
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:49,126
why I didn't pick up
this gun lying here?

663
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:50,498
What reason can there be?
You're a coward!

664
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:54,025
What reason can there be?
You're a coward!

665
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:02,299
It's a long story.

666
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:06,840
It happened during the days I was
posted at the Belapur police station.

667
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:12,251
We got information that Gabbar was
going to loot the village Haripur.

668
01:28:13,021 --> 01:28:13,621
The police raided them
at the right time...

669
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:15,054
The police raided them
at the right time...

670
01:28:15,256 --> 01:28:17,281
and the bandits had to flee.

671
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:20,123
I started chasing Gabbar.

672
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:29,349
Let me go... let go...
Leave me alone, you bastard!

673
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:31,726
Gabbar Singh! This is no arm!
This is a noose!

674
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:34,957
Gabbar Singh! This is no arm!
This is a noose!

675
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:38,825
In view of the testimonies
and the evidence at hand...

676
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:41,091
this court reaches
the conclusion that...

677
01:30:41,335 --> 01:30:45,294
Gabbar Singh is a dangerous
and professional criminal.

678
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:49,167
This court, therefore, holding
him guilty of dacoity...

679
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:54,347
sentences him to 20 years
of rigorous imprisonment.

680
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:04,915
I'll remember you...
I'm sure, I will remember you.

681
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:10,094
After 20 years in the prison,
you will forget everything, Gabbar.

682
01:31:10,498 --> 01:31:13,990
No prison in the world
has walls strong enough...

683
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:17,099
to hold Gabbar captive
for 20 long years.

684
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:23,906
And the day I escape...
you will regret it, Thakur.

685
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:28,214
You're going to regret it.
- Take him away.

686
01:31:28,449 --> 01:31:33,409
This enmity's going to
cost you dear, Thakur!

687
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:38,786
Thakur! Congratulations!

688
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:40,862
Another criminal you've nabbed
is coming to my prison.

689
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:42,329
Another criminal you've nabbed
is coming to my prison.

690
01:31:44,432 --> 01:31:48,163
He's a dangerous man, jailor.
You'd better be careful.

691
01:31:49,604 --> 01:31:52,402
I'm glad your application
for leave has come through.

692
01:31:52,907 --> 01:31:55,967
It had to anyway. You're going on
leave after a very long time.

693
01:31:57,211 --> 01:32:00,977
Had I not taken leave now, my folks
would have stopped talking to me.

694
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:03,651
It's the same story with
everyone in our profession.

695
01:32:03,651 --> 01:32:04,583
It's the same story with
everyone in our profession.

696
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,418
I face the same problem. How many
members do you have in your family?

697
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:14,826
I have two sons who are married and
a daughter of marriageable age, too.

698
01:32:15,363 --> 01:32:17,558
I want to find a nice groom
for her this time.

699
01:32:17,965 --> 01:32:21,924
I also have a grandson.
- Really? You don't look so old!

700
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:25,337
We in the village are
married very early in life.

701
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:26,607
An early marriage means
the son comes early, too.

702
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:28,598
An early marriage means
the son comes early, too.

703
01:32:29,076 --> 01:32:32,102
Since the son marries early,
he has a son very soon.

704
01:32:32,446 --> 01:32:34,243
In fact, he's about 8 years of age.
You don't visit him on leave?

705
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:38,274
You bet!

706
01:32:38,619 --> 01:32:41,850
I'm carrying gifts for everyone,
in order to pacify them.

707
01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:46,518
There you are then; I've never
accepted a bribe in my life.

708
01:32:47,161 --> 01:32:49,564
But I have to bribe my family,
whenever I go home!

709
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:50,155
But I have to bribe my family,
whenever I go home!

710
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:53,096
I must take your leave now.

711
01:32:57,505 --> 01:33:00,133
What is it?
- Gabbar Singh has escaped, sir!

712
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:02,400
Gabbar Singh has escaped?!

713
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:07,571
You've missed again!
You're no good, uncle!

714
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:11,381
Oh sure! Your father's been hunting
lions, hasn't he? Just shut up!

715
01:33:12,019 --> 01:33:12,787
You're going to the station to
receive grandpa, aren't you?

716
01:33:12,787 --> 01:33:14,652
You're going to the station to
receive grandpa, aren't you?

717
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:17,383
May I come along, too?
- Go and ask your mother.

718
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:19,182
Why don't you tell her?

719
01:33:19,393 --> 01:33:23,329
Just tell her that you're
going with me. Go on.

720
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:27,630
Mother...

721
01:33:28,202 --> 01:33:29,533
Let me cut the vegetables.

722
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:32,167
May I go to the station
with uncle, mother?

723
01:33:32,373 --> 01:33:34,273
No. You're not going
to the station.

724
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:35,776
Madam... I've asked someone
to fix the main-gate.

725
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:38,336
Madam... I've asked someone
to fix the main-gate.

726
01:33:39,246 --> 01:33:45,412
And here are the things
you had asked for...

727
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:51,150
Young mistress!
- I'm coming over!

728
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:03,227
I'm going to the temple. But if
there is anything I can do...?

729
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:05,299
Go on. I'll handle it.

730
01:34:05,506 --> 01:34:07,531
Let's go.
- Give me that.

731
01:34:11,445 --> 01:34:14,744
May I go to the station, mom?
- Haven't I said you can't?

732
01:34:15,516 --> 01:34:17,780
Let him go, if he wants to.

733
01:34:18,285 --> 01:34:21,652
No way. There are always so many
trains passing by. I'm scared.

734
01:34:21,956 --> 01:34:24,925
The trains seem to have an axe
to grind against your son.

735
01:34:25,593 --> 01:34:28,721
They'll leave their tracks
to go after him!

736
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:31,695
You have a funny logic.

737
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:35,597
So you're preparing the
vegetable father likes, eh?

738
01:34:35,903 --> 01:34:38,929
Let him go, I say.
- Okay! Go ahead and spoil him!

739
01:34:40,007 --> 01:34:42,771
Will you go like this?
Go and have a bath.

740
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:44,679
Ask your aunt to... Nirmala!
- Yes, sister-in-law?

741
01:34:44,679 --> 01:34:47,341
Ask your aunt to... Nirmala!
- Yes, sister-in-law?

742
01:34:47,648 --> 01:34:49,673
Will you get a set of clothes
out for the kid, my girl?

743
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:52,512
Right away.
- Go on.

744
01:34:53,354 --> 01:34:55,618
And you've started chewing
on the raw vegetables!

745
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:59,990
They're all busy today
to impress father!

746
01:35:00,461 --> 01:35:03,487
As if you get the witch to
do the chores every day!

747
01:35:04,031 --> 01:35:06,864
This wheel is still lying here?

748
01:35:08,102 --> 01:35:11,697
Ramlal has become
a forgetful old man.

749
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:16,900
I'd asked him to have the drawing
room and father's room cleaned.

750
01:35:17,445 --> 01:35:19,413
But he's not even to be seen.

751
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:23,514
He's away at the temple with Radha.
He will do it when he returns.

752
01:35:23,918 --> 01:35:26,614
Hey, Ninni!
- Yes, brother?

753
01:35:26,921 --> 01:35:30,687
Have a bath and get ready!
Aren't we going to the station?

754
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:33,083
I'll join you in a minute!

755
01:35:35,429 --> 01:35:40,025
I can't figure out how this silly
hunter found a wife like Radha.

756
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:43,662
It was I who asked father
to pursue the alliance.

757
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:46,462
But does anyone even
acknowledge what I've done?

758
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,766
I've found him a wife
who's one in a million!

759
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:53,504
Or girls nowadays ask for a division
the day they are married.

760
01:35:53,981 --> 01:35:57,041
Wait and see what a great match
I find for Nimmo next.

761
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:02,077
No!

762
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:32,147
Gabbar?

763
01:40:35,996 --> 01:40:37,327
Yes...

764
01:42:37,284 --> 01:42:39,184
Welcome, Thakur.

765
01:42:40,787 --> 01:42:43,483
I knew for sure
that you'd come here.

766
01:42:48,529 --> 01:42:50,759
The ass struggles!

767
01:42:51,398 --> 01:42:54,333
You contemptible bastard!
God-damn scoundrel!

768
01:42:56,303 --> 01:42:59,966
Curse me as much as you wish!
To your heart's content!

769
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:03,971
You bastard!
- Yes! Shout some more!

770
01:43:04,811 --> 01:43:08,372
Remember? I cried the other day
and you watched the fun?

771
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:11,218
You will cry your lungs out today...
and I will watch the fun!

772
01:43:11,218 --> 01:43:13,152
You will cry your lungs out today...
and I will watch the fun!

773
01:43:14,154 --> 01:43:15,917
Know what, Samba?

774
01:43:16,456 --> 01:43:21,792
I was livid at the court that
day... so very furious!

775
01:43:22,329 --> 01:43:25,389
I could have wrung his neck
there and then! The bastard!

776
01:43:26,233 --> 01:43:30,101
But I couldn't help it!
I was held by four of those cops!

777
01:43:30,604 --> 01:43:33,505
Handcuffs in my hands...
my legs shackled! Remember?

778
01:43:35,075 --> 01:43:36,975
You remember that, don't you?

779
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:43,810
Any last wish, Thakur?

780
01:43:51,124 --> 01:43:54,093
There's still a lot
of life in your arms.

781
01:43:55,862 --> 01:43:57,431
Tie him up!

782
01:43:57,431 --> 01:43:57,897
Tie him up!

783
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:13,236
I'm not going to kill you now.

784
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:20,053
After I'm through with you...
the world will spit on you.

785
01:44:20,053 --> 01:44:20,246
After I'm through with you...
the world will spit on you.

786
01:44:21,955 --> 01:44:23,946
Your arms are full of life!

787
01:44:25,525 --> 01:44:29,325
His arms are strong enough
to pull down a running horse!

788
01:44:32,299 --> 01:44:34,859
Your arms are full of life!

789
01:44:35,502 --> 01:44:38,062
D'you remember what you
had once told me?

790
01:44:38,505 --> 01:44:41,565
They aren't arms...
they're a noose!

791
01:44:42,943 --> 01:44:43,210
And here you are!
The noose has been destroyed!

792
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:46,236
And here you are!
The noose has been destroyed!

793
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:49,005
It has been ripped open!

794
01:44:50,183 --> 01:44:52,447
Arms full of life, aren't they?

795
01:44:54,388 --> 01:44:56,288
These arms...

796
01:44:57,057 --> 01:44:59,389
give them to me, Thakur.
- No!

797
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:04,226
Give me your arms, Thakur!
- No!

798
01:46:16,303 --> 01:46:18,828
Did you see anything else?
- No, sir.

799
01:46:19,906 --> 01:46:21,931
We shut our doors and windows
when we heard the gunfire.

800
01:46:22,142 --> 01:46:24,110
I see... very well.

801
01:46:25,078 --> 01:46:27,808
Put your thumb-impression here.
- Very well, sir.

802
01:46:30,417 --> 01:46:31,816
Welcome, Thakur.

803
01:46:35,088 --> 01:46:38,148
I've got to know of what happened
here, from these folks.

804
01:46:38,525 --> 01:46:40,117
I wanted to discuss
something with you.

805
01:46:40,894 --> 01:46:44,921
The police want Gabbar;
dead or alive.

806
01:46:47,033 --> 01:46:49,228
You will have him one day.

807
01:46:50,871 --> 01:46:53,499
Is there something you can
tell me about Gabbar?

808
01:46:54,274 --> 01:46:55,263
No.

809
01:46:56,343 --> 01:46:59,107
Okay. That's all I wanted to know.

810
01:46:59,546 --> 01:47:01,480
Thank you, Thakur.

811
01:47:05,852 --> 01:47:06,876
Good-bye.

812
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:25,602
We don't want that money, Thakur.

813
01:47:26,506 --> 01:47:28,497
Please take it back.

814
01:47:29,242 --> 01:47:32,006
Please don't think, we won't carry
out the mission for you.

815
01:47:35,348 --> 01:47:40,115
But didn't you say
you only work for money?

816
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:42,215
Well, we...

817
01:47:43,323 --> 01:47:45,621
We will get the money anyway.

818
01:47:47,394 --> 01:47:50,261
Once we have killed Gabbar...
- You will not kill Gabbar!

819
01:47:52,899 --> 01:47:57,927
You are here to catch Gabbar alive
and hand him over to me.

820
01:47:59,005 --> 01:48:03,066
Give me your word! That you will
hand him over to me, alive!

821
01:48:09,416 --> 01:48:15,116
We give you our word, Thakur.
But please take back the money.

822
01:48:18,992 --> 01:48:22,086
Girija, the blacksmith, brings
some news from village Titli.

823
01:48:25,265 --> 01:48:28,564
You might meet Gabbar
again very soon.

824
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:31,337
Come on.

825
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:37,366
Greetings, Thakur.
- Greetings.

826
01:48:38,144 --> 01:48:40,169
So what's news, Girija?

827
01:48:40,547 --> 01:48:43,072
There are some gypsies
staying at Pipri.

828
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:46,379
Hira and his friends
are there too.

829
01:48:47,988 --> 01:48:51,048
Hira is the one who sells
arms and ammunition to Gabbar.

830
01:48:52,125 --> 01:48:55,185
Gabbar is bound to meet him
in a couple of days.

831
01:48:55,729 --> 01:48:59,324
Strike... when the iron is hot.

832
01:49:45,779 --> 01:49:48,111
Beloved, Oh Beloved

833
01:49:54,321 --> 01:49:56,289
Oh, Beloved, Oh Beloved

834
01:50:02,662 --> 01:50:05,532
Roses Blossom In Gardens

835
01:50:05,532 --> 01:50:08,433
When We Meet In The Desert

836
01:50:11,304 --> 01:50:14,603
Me And You

837
01:50:55,181 --> 01:50:57,342
A Flower Came Out From Spring,

838
01:50:59,419 --> 01:51:02,286
The Moon Came Out From The Stars

839
01:51:07,894 --> 01:51:10,260
The Daytime Has Drowned

840
01:51:53,440 --> 01:52:06,286
The The Road Of Beauty And Love,
In Your Arms And Eyes

841
01:52:06,286 --> 01:52:09,153
My Heart Has Drowned

842
01:53:55,662 --> 01:53:57,687
My God! What happened to him?

843
01:53:58,598 --> 01:54:01,658
Don't worry. The bullet has
just grazed his arm.

844
01:54:02,402 --> 01:54:04,427
It's not a serious injury.

845
01:54:05,939 --> 01:54:08,635
We blew up almost all their
arms and explosives, Thakur...

846
01:54:09,042 --> 01:54:11,272
but Gabbar managed to escape.

847
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:14,503
It's okay. We'll get him
again someday.

848
01:54:19,652 --> 01:54:23,611
Take a swig, partner.
Your troubles will vanish.

849
01:54:24,757 --> 01:54:27,920
Should you stop drinking, it will
reduce most of your troubles.

850
01:54:29,295 --> 01:54:31,263
Would you like to...?
- God almighty!

851
01:54:55,889 --> 01:54:58,915
Greetings, lmam.
I have a letter for you.

852
01:54:59,759 --> 01:55:02,489
Here you are.
- It must be from Jabalpur.

853
01:55:03,329 --> 01:55:06,890
Could you read it for me?
- Certainly.

854
01:55:08,501 --> 01:55:10,737
Where are my glasses?
I put it in my pocket!

855
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:14,673
That which you are looking for
is here with me!

856
01:55:14,874 --> 01:55:17,069
Here you are!
- The chatterbox is here, isn't she?

857
01:55:17,610 --> 01:55:21,376
Actually, we were going in
the opposite directions.

858
01:55:21,948 --> 01:55:23,973
You were on your bicycle
and I was on foot.

859
01:55:24,417 --> 01:55:27,545
You dropped your glasses
and I picked them up!

860
01:55:27,854 --> 01:55:30,482
I guessed as much that the
glasses must belong to you.

861
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:33,782
The funny part is, it's
really yours. Actually...

862
01:55:33,993 --> 01:55:37,656
If you rest your mouth a little,
I'd know what the letter says.

863
01:55:37,864 --> 01:55:40,765
I'll listen to you later.
- Okay! When did I refuse?

864
01:55:41,034 --> 01:55:45,061
It begins with a greeting.
- Greetings himself, too.

865
01:55:46,039 --> 01:55:52,501
Everything is fine here and we
pray for your well-being.

866
01:55:53,479 --> 01:55:57,506
"The good news is that the job
for Ahmed has been finalised"

867
01:55:57,984 --> 01:56:00,009
"He will get a salary
of 200 Rupees"

868
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:03,746
"He can very well stay with me
and eat with us, too"

869
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:06,517
It's good that he will
be in his uncle's care.

870
01:56:06,893 --> 01:56:09,521
Oh yes! That's wonderful!
That's just what I wanted, too.

871
01:56:09,996 --> 01:56:12,556
"It wouldn't be proper to delay
this matter anymore"

872
01:56:12,799 --> 01:56:15,768
"I hope you will treat this
letter like a telegram"

873
01:56:16,669 --> 01:56:19,638
"Please arrange to send
Ahmed here at the earliest"

874
01:56:20,006 --> 01:56:22,839
"Everything else is fine here;
my folks send you their regards"

875
01:56:23,643 --> 01:56:27,044
"I remain, yours...
- Mukait UI-lah.

876
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:29,975
I will not listen to any
excuse from Ahmed now.

877
01:56:30,583 --> 01:56:34,110
That's right.
But he's very much here.

878
01:56:34,821 --> 01:56:37,517
Let me tell you, father.
I'm not going there.

879
01:56:38,091 --> 01:56:41,618
This is like...
- This boy is a fool!

880
01:56:42,528 --> 01:56:46,794
I have one foot in the grave and you
have your life ahead of you!

881
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:52,902
How long will you cling to me?
You don't find such jobs everyday.

882
01:56:53,106 --> 01:56:54,971
Your father is right, son.

883
01:56:55,141 --> 01:57:02,411
In fact, I've heard of people
praying at temples in the cities...

884
01:57:03,116 --> 01:57:05,778
The temple?!
- What's wrong?

885
01:57:06,486 --> 01:57:11,924
Actually, I was headed for the temple
and happened to find his glasses.

886
01:57:12,725 --> 01:57:15,159
That's it! I forgot
where I was going!

887
01:57:15,828 --> 01:57:18,524
But I've remembered it now!

888
01:57:21,634 --> 01:57:25,035
Hey, Veeru... there goes
your horse-cart girl.

889
01:57:30,977 --> 01:57:34,037
Well, Basanti...
you're on foot today.

890
01:57:34,814 --> 01:57:37,214
Has your mare run away
with the cart?

891
01:57:37,784 --> 01:57:44,053
You still don't understand
that no one elopes out here.

892
01:57:44,957 --> 01:57:47,585
My mare is honourably at home
and today being a Monday...

893
01:57:48,127 --> 01:57:53,121
aunt told me that if l pray
to Lord Shiva on every Monday...

894
01:57:53,499 --> 01:57:55,831
I'll get a husband that
the world will be stunned.

895
01:57:56,269 --> 01:58:00,831
I said, okay... I don't intend
to marry a bum anyway.

896
01:58:01,207 --> 01:58:03,937
Okay, then... I must leave.
Praise the Lord!

897
01:58:09,515 --> 01:58:11,540
Praise the Lord!

898
01:58:16,122 --> 01:58:18,147
Praise the Lord!

899
01:58:36,008 --> 01:58:40,206
Lord! There is nothing in the
world that is hidden from You.

900
01:58:40,847 --> 01:58:42,678
You are omniscient, Lord!

901
01:58:43,249 --> 01:58:45,683
I don't say that You have
forgotten it.

902
01:58:46,285 --> 01:58:48,617
But it's always good
to remind You.

903
01:58:48,888 --> 01:58:51,948
Today's a Monday and I have
a small request, Lord.

904
01:58:52,825 --> 01:58:59,162
Look at my hands, rough and rugged
from holding the reins!

905
01:58:59,732 --> 01:59:01,666
And what problems
could You have, Lord?

906
01:59:02,034 --> 01:59:06,562
Get me married into a family where
I will rule like the Queens!

907
01:59:06,906 --> 01:59:08,931
Life's gotta be fun!

908
01:59:10,309 --> 01:59:12,903
I leave the rest to You.

909
01:59:13,613 --> 01:59:15,103
Young lady...

910
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:19,775
Who spoke?

911
01:59:20,853 --> 01:59:22,878
It is I who has spoken!

912
01:59:23,956 --> 01:59:28,052
Lord! It's You!
This is a miracle!

913
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:36,563
I have found a match
for you, lady.

914
01:59:36,836 --> 01:59:39,771
In just one Monday?
That's excellent!

915
01:59:40,039 --> 01:59:42,337
You must obviously have
chosen the best!

916
01:59:42,842 --> 01:59:46,141
Could You tell me the name, perhaps?
Or do I come again next week?

917
01:59:46,879 --> 01:59:51,316
I will do as You say, Lord.
- His name is Veeru.

918
01:59:52,051 --> 01:59:57,182
Veeru?! This has to do with my life!
Please don't make haste, Lord!

919
01:59:57,390 --> 01:59:59,620
I wouldn't mind You taking
a few Mondays more.

920
02:00:00,326 --> 02:00:03,659
He's okay to look at;
but he's a bloody smart ass!

921
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:06,030
Silence, maiden!

922
02:00:06,265 --> 02:00:10,861
I never talk without reason, Lord!
I'll do as You say!

923
02:00:11,337 --> 02:00:18,106
If you don't obey my command, you
will remain a spinster all your life!

924
02:00:18,244 --> 02:00:19,836
Forgive me, Lord!

925
02:00:23,115 --> 02:00:26,380
You will continue to drive the
horse-cart all your life!

926
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:34,956
I now command you to go and tell
your aunt, in no uncertain terms...

927
02:00:35,361 --> 02:00:39,195
that it is Veeru who will be
your companion for life!

928
02:00:40,099 --> 02:00:45,401
To respect and honour Veeru
therefore shall be your prime duty!

929
02:00:46,339 --> 02:00:51,367
Because, your heavens
lie at his feet!

930
02:00:52,445 --> 02:00:57,007
Should you please him,
I shall be pleased!

931
02:00:57,984 --> 02:01:03,650
And if you irritate him,
I shall be enraged!

932
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:05,216
Really?

933
02:01:06,158 --> 02:01:08,126
So go to him...

934
02:01:24,944 --> 02:01:26,377
I thought I would...

935
02:01:27,046 --> 02:01:31,312
You thought this village belle
has no brains!

936
02:01:31,884 --> 02:01:34,944
You thought you could fool me!
You think you're smart!

937
02:01:35,421 --> 02:01:38,356
But I could outsmart guys
like you!

938
02:01:38,791 --> 02:01:41,817
Sit here and play God!
I'm going home!

939
02:01:43,763 --> 02:01:45,958
Atleast listen to me!

940
02:02:19,165 --> 02:02:24,102
When Any Beautiful Girl Sulks

941
02:02:24,403 --> 02:02:28,931
She Becomes Even More Beautiful

942
02:02:38,617 --> 02:02:44,156
When The Car Leaves The Station

943
02:02:44,156 --> 02:02:47,990
She Becomes One, Two, Three

944
02:03:12,051 --> 02:03:13,643
Go from here

945
02:03:14,053 --> 02:03:19,423
In Hands Is A Whip,
On Lips Are Curses

946
02:03:27,166 --> 02:03:34,038
Very Tricky Are Horse Carriage
Riding Women

947
02:03:37,009 --> 02:03:43,039
When Any Horse Carriage
Riding Woman Sulks

948
02:03:44,216 --> 02:03:50,086
She Becomes More Lovely

949
02:04:48,013 --> 02:04:55,044
In Hair Is Shade, On Faces Is Sunlight

950
02:05:00,259 --> 02:05:07,688
Very Tasty, Fair One Are Your
Color And Beauty

951
02:05:10,302 --> 02:05:15,205
When A Kite Breaks From lts String

952
02:05:17,877 --> 02:05:21,813
Her Face Becomes Colorful

953
02:05:57,182 --> 02:05:59,309
I've thought of
something today.

954
02:06:00,219 --> 02:06:02,414
You must do that,
once in a while.

955
02:06:03,055 --> 02:06:05,717
I've taken a very
crucial decision today.

956
02:06:06,525 --> 02:06:11,630
I know what your decision is;
you want to marry Basanti.

957
02:06:11,630 --> 02:06:14,258
That's wonderful!
You're a true friend!

958
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:16,998
Only a friend could
know how I feel!

959
02:06:17,202 --> 02:06:22,504
But I also know that this is your
8th decision to marry this year.

960
02:06:23,342 --> 02:06:24,570
But this is final!

961
02:06:24,710 --> 02:06:27,440
Really? No wonder... you've been
drinking from early this morning.

962
02:06:30,449 --> 02:06:33,043
Will you do something for me?
- What is it?

963
02:06:33,652 --> 02:06:38,112
Go and talk to Basanti's aunt;
make such an impression...

964
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:40,358
that the old lady is compelled
to propose our marriage!

965
02:06:40,492 --> 02:06:42,255
Why must I do that?

966
02:06:42,461 --> 02:06:44,554
It's the groom's folks who
approach the bride's parents!

967
02:06:45,130 --> 02:06:48,361
Besides, you're the only one
I have in the world, my friend!

968
02:06:49,401 --> 02:06:51,733
It's your wedding, okay?
So go and do this yourself.

969
02:06:52,371 --> 02:06:56,171
Give it a thought...
a cozy home, after marriage!

970
02:06:56,609 --> 02:06:59,169
A home that is yours.
- A loving wife...

971
02:06:59,612 --> 02:07:01,273
Your wife.
- A handful of kids...

972
02:07:01,647 --> 02:07:04,673
All yours, too.
- You're the one they'll call uncle!

973
02:07:05,217 --> 02:07:08,209
They'll forever pester you,
play with you all the time...

974
02:07:08,587 --> 02:07:12,546
and ask you
to tell them a story!

975
02:07:16,328 --> 02:07:19,559
Which means I'm going to play
the maid-servant in your house.

976
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:23,764
It's clear now!
You are no friend!

977
02:07:24,703 --> 02:07:26,728
To hell with such a...

978
02:07:31,610 --> 02:07:36,309
Acting pricey, aren't you? Because
no one else can do this for me?

979
02:07:38,450 --> 02:07:41,715
Had only my mom been alive,
I'd have settled down in life!

980
02:07:42,488 --> 02:07:44,456
I'd even have had kids!

981
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:48,583
Had my old man been around, he'd
have celebrated my wedding in style!

982
02:07:48,794 --> 02:07:51,354
Had I brothers and sisters,
they'd have begged the old lady...

983
02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:54,392
but seen to it that
I married Basanti.

984
02:07:54,833 --> 02:07:59,532
But don't you forget! Those without
support, have God on their side!

985
02:08:00,272 --> 02:08:01,705
Lord Almighty!

986
02:08:03,308 --> 02:08:05,276
You're not the friend I knew!

987
02:08:05,511 --> 02:08:08,571
You don't want me to give up crime
and settle down in life!

988
02:08:10,182 --> 02:08:15,245
What had I imagined you to be...
and what you really are!

989
02:08:19,892 --> 02:08:24,693
The bloody clown...
he's forever up to dramatics!

990
02:08:26,465 --> 02:08:29,593
Cut the act! I'll go and talk
it over with the old lady.

991
02:08:30,369 --> 02:08:31,495
Will you, really?!

992
02:08:31,670 --> 02:08:31,704
An unmarried girl at home is
like a burden on the soul, son.

993
02:08:31,704 --> 02:08:38,610
An unmarried girl at home is
like a burden on the soul, son.

994
02:08:38,811 --> 02:08:42,747
I can be at peace, only when
Basanti is married.

995
02:08:43,282 --> 02:08:47,343
You're right. You are indeed
bearing a burden.

996
02:08:47,753 --> 02:08:50,779
But I can't just dump her
in a well, can I?

997
02:08:51,657 --> 02:08:54,922
Please don't mind this,
but I must ask...

998
02:08:55,494 --> 02:09:00,932
about the suitor's family,
his habits and his earnings.

999
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:07,666
As far as earnings go,
once he is married...

1000
02:09:08,607 --> 02:09:10,802
he will start earning
to fend for them.

1001
02:09:11,243 --> 02:09:13,973
Doesn't he earning anything
at the moment, then?

1002
02:09:14,613 --> 02:09:16,672
Of course, he does!
When did I say that he doesn't?

1003
02:09:16,882 --> 02:09:20,716
It's like this; no one can
win all the time, can he?

1004
02:09:21,820 --> 02:09:24,084
There are times the poor chap
even loses money.

1005
02:09:24,656 --> 02:09:26,556
Loses money?
- That's right...

1006
02:09:26,992 --> 02:09:30,223
but that's gambling, you know.
There's little I can say about it.

1007
02:09:30,696 --> 02:09:33,599
My God! Is he a gambler?

1008
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:36,659
Not at all, madam!
It's a shame to call him a gambler!

1009
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:39,936
He's a gem of a person;
decent and straight.

1010
02:09:40,706 --> 02:09:46,076
But when someone is high on liquor,
he can't see things in perspective.

1011
02:09:46,879 --> 02:09:51,077
They force him into gambling.
How's poor Veeru to blame?

1012
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:58,179
You're right, son. A drinker and
a gambler... and yet, faultless!

1013
02:09:58,290 --> 02:10:03,922
You're misunderstanding my friend.
He's an innocent, young chap.

1014
02:10:04,730 --> 02:10:07,130
Just get him married to Basanti...

1015
02:10:07,766 --> 02:10:10,758
he'll give up drinking
and gambling in no time!

1016
02:10:10,903 --> 02:10:13,269
Don't tell me, son.
I know better.

1017
02:10:13,906 --> 02:10:17,137
Has anyone ever been able to kick
habits like drinking and gambling?

1018
02:10:17,309 --> 02:10:21,803
You don't know Veeru. Believe me,
he's not at all like that.

1019
02:10:22,247 --> 02:10:25,683
Once he's married, he'll stop
visiting the nautch girl. Period!

1020
02:10:25,884 --> 02:10:27,681
His drinking problem will be
solved on its own!

1021
02:10:27,853 --> 02:10:32,688
Good Lord! That's all he lacked!
He even visits brothels, does he?

1022
02:10:33,091 --> 02:10:35,082
So what's wrong with that?

1023
02:10:35,861 --> 02:10:40,230
Even kings and princes have
often patronised dancing-girls!

1024
02:10:41,099 --> 02:10:46,594
I see... but can you tell me which
family your friend hails from?

1025
02:10:46,972 --> 02:10:50,305
We'll let you know that,
the moment we get to know of it!

1026
02:10:50,709 --> 02:10:56,705
I must say one thing, son.
For all your friend's vices...

1027
02:10:56,949 --> 02:11:00,851
you can only praise him!

1028
02:11:01,019 --> 02:11:04,079
I can't help it, aunt.
I'm really soft at heart.

1029
02:11:05,791 --> 02:11:09,194
So, do I take it then that
they will soon be married?

1030
02:11:09,194 --> 02:11:12,630
Married? It's okay even if she
remains a spinster all her life!

1031
02:11:12,931 --> 02:11:15,297
But I will not let Basanti
marry such a man!

1032
02:11:15,701 --> 02:11:17,726
I'm her aunt; not her step-mother!

1033
02:11:19,738 --> 02:11:24,801
It's strange that you refuse,
despite the best of my efforts.

1034
02:11:26,411 --> 02:11:31,178
Poor Veeru. I don't know
how he will deal with this.

1035
02:11:32,150 --> 02:11:32,184
I'll take a jump and die!
Out of my way!

1036
02:11:32,184 --> 02:11:37,747
I'll take a jump and die!
Out of my way!

1037
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:39,880
Hey, watch it!
What are you doing?

1038
02:11:40,058 --> 02:11:44,825
I'm doing just what every
legendary lover has done!

1039
02:11:45,764 --> 02:11:51,066
They died for their beloveds!

1040
02:11:51,970 --> 02:11:53,995
Suicide!

1041
02:11:57,876 --> 02:11:59,639
Well now... what is suicide?

1042
02:12:00,379 --> 02:12:02,973
When the English die,
they call it suicide.

1043
02:12:03,782 --> 02:12:06,410
But why do the English die?

1044
02:12:07,953 --> 02:12:11,787
What's up, feller? Why do you
want to commit suicide?

1045
02:12:12,024 --> 02:12:16,893
You'd rather not ask!
You'll break into tears!

1046
02:12:17,195 --> 02:12:19,993
It's a very sad story!

1047
02:12:20,299 --> 02:12:25,202
It has emotions, drama
and tragedy!

1048
02:12:26,271 --> 02:12:30,799
You know Basanti, don't you?
I was going to marry her.

1049
02:12:31,443 --> 02:12:36,005
But her wicked aunt has
been an obstacle!

1050
02:12:37,015 --> 02:12:40,143
I can't live in this big,
bad world, anymore!

1051
02:12:40,953 --> 02:12:47,119
I bid you farewell, villagers!
Good-bye!

1052
02:12:50,429 --> 02:12:52,454
Well... what is "good-bye"?

1053
02:12:53,165 --> 02:12:55,759
When the English leave,
it's called "good-bye".

1054
02:12:56,168 --> 02:12:58,728
But where do the English go?

1055
02:12:58,937 --> 02:13:01,997
Hey, villagers! Here I go!

1056
02:13:02,908 --> 02:13:07,174
God Almighty! Here I come!
- Hold it! Wait...!

1057
02:13:07,479 --> 02:13:14,408
What?! Okay, if you insist,
I'll wait for a while.

1058
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:18,847
Hey... you're a strange friend!
You're sitting here unaffected!

1059
02:13:19,391 --> 02:13:21,416
Why? What's wrong?
- How am I to know?

1060
02:13:21,827 --> 02:13:24,728
Look at your friend!
He's climbed all the way up there!

1061
02:13:26,331 --> 02:13:28,322
You see that, don't you?!

1062
02:13:30,135 --> 02:13:32,330
Yes, I do.
But nothing's going to happen.

1063
02:13:33,071 --> 02:13:35,266
He'll climb down,
when he sobers down.

1064
02:13:36,241 --> 02:13:40,268
I've seen many cruel people.
But not a heartless friend like you!

1065
02:13:41,013 --> 02:13:42,503
Hey, watch out!

1066
02:13:43,415 --> 02:13:47,511
I have no one in the world!
Nor friend, nor buddy...

1067
02:13:48,787 --> 02:13:50,914
So I'm going to end my life!

1068
02:13:51,456 --> 02:13:54,186
But I must warn you, villagers!

1069
02:13:55,060 --> 02:14:01,226
Where a lover ends his life, the
village is wrought with calamities!

1070
02:14:01,833 --> 02:14:03,494
What calamities will
we have to face?

1071
02:14:03,835 --> 02:14:10,502
There will be famine and drought!
Diseases and death!

1072
02:14:10,976 --> 02:14:15,879
And all that only for the sake of
that old hag! That old hag indeed!

1073
02:14:16,014 --> 02:14:17,208
My God!

1074
02:14:17,983 --> 02:14:22,181
You will see for yourselves!
When I die...

1075
02:14:23,155 --> 02:14:28,218
the police will arrive and take
the old hag away to jail!

1076
02:14:29,461 --> 02:14:36,526
In jail, the old hag will
labour on the grindstone...!

1077
02:14:38,303 --> 02:14:40,863
You'd better agree, lady.
Or he'll kill himself!

1078
02:14:41,073 --> 02:14:43,507
But how can I agree, Dinanath?!

1079
02:14:44,276 --> 02:14:49,339
You don't have to beg for anything
from the hag, villagers!

1080
02:14:50,215 --> 02:14:52,240
Nothing can stop me now!

1081
02:14:52,551 --> 02:14:54,576
I will certainly end my life!

1082
02:14:57,456 --> 02:15:00,118
Here goes; one, two, three...

1083
02:15:00,592 --> 02:15:02,253
Please, aunt! Agree to what he says!

1084
02:15:02,627 --> 02:15:05,095
You'd better agree, or do the rounds
of the courts and police stations!

1085
02:15:05,397 --> 02:15:07,422
But I've never been a court
or a police station!

1086
02:15:08,033 --> 02:15:09,500
Then you'd better agree.
- All right.

1087
02:15:10,102 --> 02:15:13,333
Stop that, Veeru!
I agree!

1088
02:15:15,073 --> 02:15:17,439
The old lady has agreed!
Now quietly come down!

1089
02:15:18,577 --> 02:15:21,478
Who wants to marry
the old lady!

1090
02:15:22,047 --> 02:15:26,211
It's Dhanno... I mean,
it's Basanti I want to marry.

1091
02:15:26,585 --> 02:15:30,021
I'm willing to marry you, Veeru!
Come down now!

1092
02:15:30,355 --> 02:15:34,257
Hear that, villagers?

1093
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:38,120
The old lady is willing...
and so is Basanti!

1094
02:15:38,396 --> 02:15:41,229
So my death has been cancelled!

1095
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:45,036
I'm coming down, aunt...
my adorable aunt!

1096
02:15:45,504 --> 02:15:47,096
I'm coming down...

1097
02:15:53,078 --> 02:15:55,103
What am I going to do now?!

1098
02:16:14,065 --> 02:16:16,465
So long, father.
- You're leaving, are you?

1099
02:16:16,835 --> 02:16:18,700
Go on... my God protect you.

1100
02:16:18,937 --> 02:16:20,928
Write to me, the moment
you reach there.

1101
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:26,670
You're a very careless eater;
look after your health, okay?

1102
02:16:27,812 --> 02:16:30,804
As my father, God bless his soul,
used to say...

1103
02:16:31,116 --> 02:16:34,950
in good health lies
true happiness and wealth.

1104
02:16:36,087 --> 02:16:38,749
Let me walk with you for a while.
I'll get myself some air, too.

1105
02:16:39,457 --> 02:16:42,392
It's okay, father. Relax...
I'll go away from here.

1106
02:16:43,461 --> 02:16:47,727
Really? Okay, then...
Let's embrace.

1107
02:16:52,804 --> 02:16:53,038
Hurry up, Junga... I hold
the Queen of clubs.

1108
02:16:53,038 --> 02:16:55,131
Hurry up, Junga... I hold
the Queen of clubs.

1109
02:16:55,907 --> 02:17:00,071
That's okay, Samba. But look there;
the easy prey.

1110
02:17:34,546 --> 02:17:36,537
Chief...
- Yes?

1111
02:17:36,848 --> 02:17:38,873
This boy's from Ramgarh.

1112
02:17:39,718 --> 02:17:42,778
He was on his way to the station,
when we found him.

1113
02:19:12,110 --> 02:19:15,876
Why's there so much
of silence here?

1114
02:19:25,357 --> 02:19:27,587
Imam Saheb...
- Who's that?

1115
02:19:29,160 --> 02:19:34,223
Veeru? Why's there so much
of silence here, son?

1116
02:19:36,334 --> 02:19:38,564
Please come with me.

1117
02:19:39,637 --> 02:19:41,832
Please come...
- What's wrong?

1118
02:19:43,775 --> 02:19:46,835
What's up, son?
Where are you leading me...

1119
02:19:49,047 --> 02:19:50,309
Who's that?

1120
02:19:57,255 --> 02:19:58,347
Ahmed?!

1121
02:20:02,127 --> 02:20:03,617
Ahmed!

1122
02:20:27,252 --> 02:20:30,744
Imam Saheb, I must...

1123
02:20:30,889 --> 02:20:34,017
How will you console him, Thakur?
You're responsible for all this.

1124
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:36,884
It's true!

1125
02:20:37,962 --> 02:20:43,093
And you villagers had better listen
to this letter from Gabbar, too!

1126
02:20:44,969 --> 02:20:48,735
Addressed to the people of
Ramgarh, it says, "Look at the..."

1127
02:20:49,340 --> 02:20:52,776
"consequences of challenging me
at the Thakur's instigation"

1128
02:20:54,012 --> 02:20:57,038
"Should you folks still
not mend your ways..."

1129
02:20:57,916 --> 02:21:01,079
"death shall perform its ugly dance
in every courtyard of Ramgarh!"

1130
02:21:02,153 --> 02:21:06,419
"Should you care for the lives
of your family and children..."

1131
02:21:07,158 --> 02:21:08,921
"then before sunrise tomorrow..."

1132
02:21:09,294 --> 02:21:14,357
"hand over the Thakur's men
to me, at the old hillock"

1133
02:21:15,099 --> 02:21:17,966
He has signed it off as
"Gabbar Singh, chief of the bandits."

1134
02:21:19,270 --> 02:21:23,297
How could you land us in such
a grave danger, Thakur!

1135
02:21:34,018 --> 02:21:40,389
To lead an honourable life, we will
have to pay a price, Dinanath.

1136
02:21:42,794 --> 02:21:46,286
We can pay the bandits with
food-grains for our lives.

1137
02:21:46,998 --> 02:21:49,228
We can't pay them with
our children's lives!

1138
02:21:49,934 --> 02:21:52,368
We're farmers, after all.
We are not soldiers.

1139
02:21:53,037 --> 02:21:56,268
You are right, Shankar.
We are indeed farmers.

1140
02:21:57,775 --> 02:22:00,403
This has been a country
of farmers for many ages.

1141
02:22:01,813 --> 02:22:04,941
But whenever someone evil has
shown aggressive designs...

1142
02:22:05,483 --> 02:22:10,011
by God, it was farmers who
melted their ploughs into swords!

1143
02:22:11,956 --> 02:22:17,019
It's not the blood of cowards
that flows in our veins! No!

1144
02:22:17,228 --> 02:22:20,720
But how is violence and bloodshed
going to help?

1145
02:22:21,266 --> 02:22:23,291
Non-violence has its place, too.

1146
02:22:24,302 --> 02:22:26,896
I do believe in non-violence.

1147
02:22:27,772 --> 02:22:29,433
But it won't be an
act of non-violence...

1148
02:22:29,807 --> 02:22:31,502
...to grovel before
a wicked and evil man!

1149
02:22:31,910 --> 02:22:34,208
It's nothing but cowardliness!
Plain spinelessness!

1150
02:22:34,846 --> 02:22:37,371
Those who don't bow
are broken down, Thakur!

1151
02:22:38,116 --> 02:22:41,347
This Thakur can neither be made
to bow nor be broken down!

1152
02:22:42,287 --> 02:22:45,085
This Thakur can only die!

1153
02:22:46,357 --> 02:22:50,919
But I will live in dignity,
till as long as I live!

1154
02:22:51,396 --> 02:22:54,490
For how long are you going to live?
And how long will we live either...

1155
02:22:54,899 --> 02:22:56,924
with these guys
around in the village?

1156
02:23:00,271 --> 02:23:03,107
If you think you can save
your children's lives...

1157
02:23:03,107 --> 02:23:05,132
by handing us over
to Gabbar Singh...

1158
02:23:05,410 --> 02:23:12,373
you can very well give us
up to Gabbar. We are willing.

1159
02:23:13,384 --> 02:23:15,545
Yes. We must do
the right thing now.

1160
02:23:16,421 --> 02:23:18,981
We can't bear the burden
of this problem anymore.

1161
02:23:22,827 --> 02:23:25,352
Who's speaking of not
bearing the burden?

1162
02:23:26,998 --> 02:23:30,399
Do you know what is the biggest
burden in the world?

1163
02:23:32,837 --> 02:23:35,431
A father bearing
the bier of his son!

1164
02:23:36,274 --> 02:23:38,469
There can be no bigger burden.

1165
02:23:40,411 --> 02:23:42,811
An old man like me is willing
to bear this burden...

1166
02:23:43,448 --> 02:23:47,544
and you refuse
to combat a problem?

1167
02:23:49,887 --> 02:23:53,948
There's something I very
strongly believe in.

1168
02:23:56,094 --> 02:23:59,586
An honourable death is anyday
better than a life of humiliation.

1169
02:24:01,566 --> 02:24:04,330
It's I, who has lost a son.

1170
02:24:05,870 --> 02:24:09,169
But I'd still want both of them
to stay on in this village.

1171
02:24:10,575 --> 02:24:12,600
I leave the rest to you.

1172
02:24:20,385 --> 02:24:22,410
It's time for my prayers.

1173
02:24:23,921 --> 02:24:27,982
I will ask God today
why He did not give me...

1174
02:24:28,393 --> 02:24:31,419
some more sons to be
sacrificed for the village.

1175
02:24:34,599 --> 02:24:37,966
Will someone please help me
reach the mosque...?

1176
02:26:10,895 --> 02:26:12,886
What's that? A letter?

1177
02:26:13,064 --> 02:26:16,158
Of course, you idiot!
Read it.

1178
02:26:17,101 --> 02:26:21,561
"If you kill one villager, Gabbar,
we will slay four of your men."

1179
02:26:22,974 --> 02:26:26,808
Check out if it's those guys, or
have they dumped someone else here?

1180
02:27:04,115 --> 02:27:10,247
"For every villager you kill, Gabbar,
we will slay four of your men."

1181
02:27:23,167 --> 02:27:25,158
The fun begins now!

1182
02:27:26,571 --> 02:27:31,167
It's ages since I've run into
someone who boasts so much!

1183
02:27:33,277 --> 02:27:35,507
The real fun begins now!

1184
02:27:37,081 --> 02:27:42,917
This game will end with the
lives of these two guys.

1185
02:27:44,255 --> 02:27:47,918
Every family and household in
Ramgarh, will end with this, too!

1186
02:27:55,333 --> 02:27:57,528
Here you are.

1187
02:28:00,004 --> 02:28:01,995
It was really bothering you.

1188
02:28:18,756 --> 02:28:20,781
She's a very unfortunate girl.

1189
02:28:21,559 --> 02:28:24,289
It's almost as if she has
forgotten to speak.

1190
02:28:25,229 --> 02:28:29,689
As for earlier, I'm always reminded
of those days...

1191
02:28:30,801 --> 02:28:33,827
when I first visited her village
with my master.

1192
02:28:34,939 --> 02:28:36,770
It was on the festival
of colours.

1193
02:28:37,275 --> 02:28:39,266
Hey! That's enough!

1194
02:28:39,677 --> 02:28:43,943
It's the festival of colours!
No one can take offense!

1195
02:28:44,849 --> 02:28:47,909
How will I celebrate with your father
if you douse all the colours on me?

1196
02:28:48,252 --> 02:28:50,550
How will you celebrate the festival
with my father in any case?

1197
02:28:50,755 --> 02:28:52,780
He just doesn't know how
to celebrate the festival!

1198
02:28:53,324 --> 02:28:55,554
He's been sitting at home
all day!

1199
02:28:55,927 --> 02:28:59,192
Either he touches the feet
of the elders visiting him...

1200
02:28:59,597 --> 02:29:01,929
or the younger ones touch his
feet as a mark of respect.

1201
02:29:02,633 --> 02:29:06,330
They apply a pinch of colour on
each other's forehead from a plate...

1202
02:29:06,837 --> 02:29:09,362
embrace each other and
that's it! They've celebrated it!

1203
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:13,276
That's no way of doing it!
It's us, who really celebrate it!

1204
02:29:13,644 --> 02:29:16,306
Really? And how do
you celebrate it?

1205
02:29:17,548 --> 02:29:19,413
You know Paro, don't you?

1206
02:29:19,684 --> 02:29:21,811
Paro?
- Yes! Paro!

1207
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:27,753
There's a tank in her courtyard.
We've mixed all the colours in it!

1208
02:29:28,025 --> 02:29:29,959
Where folks normally douse
colour on people...

1209
02:29:30,328 --> 02:29:32,762
we dump people
in the colours!

1210
02:29:32,964 --> 02:29:36,900
The moment we spot someone,
he goes straight in the tank!

1211
02:29:38,035 --> 02:29:40,697
I hope you don't have a tank
of colours in your house!

1212
02:29:41,405 --> 02:29:43,805
Or Ramlal and I will find
ourselves neck-deep in it.

1213
02:29:47,011 --> 02:29:48,842
Watch what I do!

1214
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:51,009
Anyone in, mister?

1215
02:29:51,649 --> 02:29:52,877
Who's that?

1216
02:29:54,452 --> 02:29:56,784
I've scared you again!
- You're crazy!

1217
02:29:57,855 --> 02:29:59,823
The Thakur!
You didn't even tell me!

1218
02:30:00,024 --> 02:30:02,584
Welcome! Greetings of the season!

1219
02:30:04,528 --> 02:30:07,258
What are you standing there for?

1220
02:30:07,565 --> 02:30:10,363
Won't you bring some sweets
for the Thakur?

1221
02:30:10,534 --> 02:30:11,831
Just a moment...

1222
02:30:12,036 --> 02:30:13,970
Must I bring the plate too?
- Which one?

1223
02:30:14,638 --> 02:30:16,629
The one from which you will
take a pinch of colour...

1224
02:30:16,807 --> 02:30:18,798
Sure, go ahead and bring it.

1225
02:30:20,444 --> 02:30:22,275
Please come, Thakur.

1226
02:30:22,913 --> 02:30:26,940
Let's go and sit there...
it's very loud out here.

1227
02:30:28,019 --> 02:30:31,546
So, Ramlal? Is everything fine?
- I'm fine, thank you, sir.

1228
02:30:32,556 --> 02:30:35,423
Well, Thakur? I hope you've
had a nice crop this year.

1229
02:30:35,693 --> 02:30:38,287
Actually, I'm an outsider
in my own house.

1230
02:30:38,729 --> 02:30:41,630
It's Ramlal who knows everything
about my farms.

1231
02:30:42,366 --> 02:30:44,732
It's he who commands things
in our farms.

1232
02:30:45,803 --> 02:30:49,569
Sweets for everyone!

1233
02:30:50,041 --> 02:30:52,009
Open your mouth, uncle!

1234
02:30:53,377 --> 02:30:54,742
That's enough, dear...

1235
02:30:55,346 --> 02:30:57,678
Okay, Mr Ramlal...
open your mouth!

1236
02:30:58,449 --> 02:31:00,518
Give it to me, dear. I'll have it.
- No, sir!

1237
02:31:00,518 --> 02:31:02,918
I will feed you!
- Give it to me, dear.

1238
02:31:03,654 --> 02:31:06,782
She's like your daughter, Ramlal.
Let her feed you.

1239
02:31:07,091 --> 02:31:09,821
He's right. Now open your mouth!

1240
02:31:12,630 --> 02:31:15,599
My God! How could I forget the
plate with the colours?

1241
02:31:17,368 --> 02:31:18,699
She's a very jovial girl.

1242
02:31:18,836 --> 02:31:22,772
You bet! She's always
kicking up a racket!

1243
02:31:23,507 --> 02:31:25,873
Here I come with
the plate of colours!

1244
02:31:26,710 --> 02:31:30,646
Here's the plate of colours for you
to take a pinch out of it!

1245
02:31:30,848 --> 02:31:33,749
I'm leaving!
- Where are you going?

1246
02:31:34,985 --> 02:31:38,921
I'm going to my friends to celebrate!
May I leave?

1247
02:31:40,157 --> 02:31:42,625
Haven't you had enough
of the colours yet?

1248
02:31:44,128 --> 02:31:49,794
It's a festival of colours, uncle...
of all hues!

1249
02:31:50,534 --> 02:31:52,559
How can anyone ever have
enough of the colours?

1250
02:31:52,736 --> 02:31:57,400
Tell me; wouldn't the world be
so dull, without these colours?

1251
02:32:05,716 --> 02:32:08,514
How dull and lifeless her world
has suddenly come to be.

1252
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:13,420
With her tears having washed away
her bridal-henna...

1253
02:32:13,624 --> 02:32:15,888
what colours can
she look forward to in life?

1254
02:33:43,747 --> 02:33:49,845
I've taken a decision.

1255
02:33:50,754 --> 02:33:53,780
Really? So you've started
taking decisions too?!

1256
02:33:55,693 --> 02:33:59,060
Yes. When you are into it,
I think I'd rather do it too.

1257
02:33:59,797 --> 02:34:01,992
What is that?
- Get married.

1258
02:34:03,934 --> 02:34:05,196
Get married?!

1259
02:34:07,037 --> 02:34:09,139
You want to get married?!

1260
02:34:09,139 --> 02:34:11,164
Yes... I've had enough.

1261
02:34:12,142 --> 02:34:15,202
I've now decided to lead
a straight and simple life.

1262
02:34:16,280 --> 02:34:19,841
In which I have a house of my own,
a wife, many children...

1263
02:34:20,751 --> 02:34:22,820
who will pester you
for stories...

1264
02:34:22,820 --> 02:34:26,119
Hey! That's enough!
Sit down here, will you?

1265
02:34:26,857 --> 02:34:28,882
Sit down here, I say.

1266
02:34:30,995 --> 02:34:35,625
I hope you know that you need
a girl to get married to?

1267
02:34:37,201 --> 02:34:39,226
Have you approved of a girl then?

1268
02:34:40,304 --> 02:34:42,829
Yes, I have.
- Who is she, may I ask?

1269
02:34:48,245 --> 02:34:49,872
That Radha?!

1270
02:34:50,614 --> 02:34:52,980
Are you mad? Don't you know
who she is?

1271
02:34:54,051 --> 02:35:00,615
Now look; even thugs and criminals
are given a second chance in life.

1272
02:35:01,225 --> 02:35:03,216
And then, Radha has done
nothing wrong.

1273
02:35:03,727 --> 02:35:06,025
Has she no right to start
life afresh?

1274
02:35:06,697 --> 02:35:11,725
How can that be? What will society
and community think of it?

1275
02:35:11,935 --> 02:35:17,874
The society and community are
meant to save man from loneliness.

1276
02:35:18,942 --> 02:35:21,137
They're not meant to
isolate someone.

1277
02:35:22,046 --> 02:35:26,312
Besides, must we let Radha suffer
in silence for fear of society?

1278
02:35:29,320 --> 02:35:33,780
How long are we going to live
anyway? We might soon be dead.

1279
02:35:35,192 --> 02:35:38,958
Whose support will she live on?
Whom will she turn to?

1280
02:35:40,297 --> 02:35:43,027
It was because of all this
that I came to you.

1281
02:35:44,301 --> 02:35:47,759
But you are her father.
I leave the decision to you.

1282
02:35:48,205 --> 02:35:50,867
Not at all, Thakur.
She's your daughter now.

1283
02:35:52,643 --> 02:35:55,703
Whatever you decide will be
best for her.

1284
02:35:57,114 --> 02:36:00,845
I'd still want you to
meet Jai at least once.

1285
02:36:01,885 --> 02:36:03,876
I'll send him over
in a couple of days.

1286
02:36:21,071 --> 02:36:23,096
A penny for your thoughts!

1287
02:36:24,875 --> 02:36:26,035
It's nothing.

1288
02:36:26,944 --> 02:36:31,176
I get it! I know what
you're worrying about.

1289
02:36:32,182 --> 02:36:36,642
You're wondering whether your
proposal will come through.

1290
02:36:37,254 --> 02:36:39,245
I suggest you toss again.

1291
02:36:39,957 --> 02:36:43,984
If it's Heads, it's gonna
be okay. Or else... well!

1292
02:36:46,730 --> 02:36:52,828
If everything works out
well, Veeru...

1293
02:36:53,904 --> 02:36:56,304
why don't we settle down here,
in this village?

1294
02:36:56,774 --> 02:36:59,208
There! You've spoken my heart!

1295
02:37:00,110 --> 02:37:02,135
I've been thinking of this, too.

1296
02:37:02,279 --> 02:37:04,747
It's no use being thieves
all our lives.

1297
02:37:04,948 --> 02:37:06,973
We've spent enough time
in the prisons.

1298
02:37:07,351 --> 02:37:10,081
Once we get the money,
let's settle down here.

1299
02:37:10,821 --> 02:37:13,881
We'll buy some land and
turn farmers.

1300
02:37:14,224 --> 02:37:18,923
But we can't use the plough...
how will we be farmers?

1301
02:37:20,798 --> 02:37:25,132
Our vices taught us to wield guns;
our virtues will teach us this.

1302
02:37:25,335 --> 02:37:28,964
You're right. Necessity does
teach a man a lot in life.

1303
02:37:29,406 --> 02:37:31,772
I've already worked out
everything for myself!

1304
02:37:32,176 --> 02:37:33,973
I'll marry the girl
who drives the horse-cart...

1305
02:37:34,178 --> 02:37:37,045
and be the father of a
couple of children in 23 years.

1306
02:37:37,781 --> 02:37:39,339
I've even thought
of the brats' names!

1307
02:37:39,950 --> 02:37:44,114
And when I ask my wife
where the kids are...

1308
02:37:44,321 --> 02:37:45,754
She'll say...

1309
02:37:46,123 --> 02:37:49,854
"They must be with your friend Jai
to listen to his stories"

1310
02:37:52,396 --> 02:37:56,924
Why must you always send your
children to me for stories?

1311
02:37:57,468 --> 02:38:01,063
You know I can't remember
these bloody stories, Jai!

1312
02:38:01,872 --> 02:38:05,899
Stories, my foot! You don't even
remember what happened yesterday.

1313
02:38:06,043 --> 02:38:09,410
Yesterday? Of course I remember
I met Basanti yesterday!

1314
02:38:10,080 --> 02:38:12,742
We've promised to meet
at the lake this morning!

1315
02:38:13,250 --> 02:38:15,946
This morning, huh?
- Yes!

1316
02:38:17,421 --> 02:38:19,355
Here I go!

1317
02:38:38,175 --> 02:38:39,870
Let's go, Dhanno!

1318
02:38:49,052 --> 02:38:53,853
Let's go! It's a question
of my chastity today!

1319
02:39:21,018 --> 02:39:23,418
Go on, Dhanno! Faster!

1320
02:40:01,925 --> 02:40:04,325
Faster, Dhanno! Go for it!

1321
02:42:37,013 --> 02:42:41,848
What do these guys in Ramgarh
feed their daughters with?

1322
02:42:43,720 --> 02:42:48,953
Look at her... she's one hell
of a spicy doll, isn't she?

1323
02:42:50,961 --> 02:42:52,656
Damn spicy, all right!

1324
02:42:53,130 --> 02:42:57,658
Remember how we went to Jamnadas's
daughter's wedding last year, chief?

1325
02:42:58,201 --> 02:42:59,896
She'd given them a terrific
dance performance there.

1326
02:43:00,103 --> 02:43:01,593
Wow!

1327
02:43:03,673 --> 02:43:04,731
She must be a sizzling dancer!

1328
02:43:06,943 --> 02:43:10,276
Show us a couple
of steps, darling.

1329
02:43:11,882 --> 02:43:15,648
Now look, lady... don't you
act too high and mighty!

1330
02:43:16,253 --> 02:43:21,850
Or I'll scratch off this
beautiful skin... all right?

1331
02:43:30,167 --> 02:43:31,930
Wait a minute, darling.

1332
02:43:35,939 --> 02:43:37,600
Tie the bastard!

1333
02:43:45,882 --> 02:43:48,646
You seem to be thick with him,
what say?

1334
02:43:56,726 --> 02:44:01,857
Well, strong man? Mohammad
comes to the mountain, eh?

1335
02:44:02,933 --> 02:44:06,699
You have a scene with
that babe, do you?

1336
02:44:07,204 --> 02:44:12,574
You bastard! I've yet to see
a creep like you!

1337
02:44:13,310 --> 02:44:15,301
You won't get to see one either.

1338
02:44:18,682 --> 02:44:21,207
Because your life is
now going to end.

1339
02:44:22,285 --> 02:44:24,310
The bastard...
- No!

1340
02:44:35,932 --> 02:44:38,594
Like a house on fire, eh?

1341
02:44:44,174 --> 02:44:46,734
You're pretty thick, aren't you?

1342
02:44:48,078 --> 02:44:52,947
Pick up your gun, Samba!

1343
02:44:56,152 --> 02:44:58,620
And aim your gun at this cur!

1344
02:45:02,726 --> 02:45:04,751
Now listen to me, darling.

1345
02:45:05,095 --> 02:45:10,727
If you wish to save your lover,
show us some dance.

1346
02:45:10,967 --> 02:45:15,904
No! Don't you dare dance
before this dogs, Basanti!

1347
02:45:22,212 --> 02:45:26,649
Delay this any longer, and we'll
blow your lover's head apart!

1348
02:45:28,118 --> 02:45:31,645
There's another thing
I must tell you, darling.

1349
02:45:32,722 --> 02:45:36,818
That man will breathe,
only till you continue to dance.

1350
02:45:38,194 --> 02:45:42,221
That gun will go off, the
moment your feet stop moving.

1351
02:46:28,111 --> 02:46:34,880
Yes, As Long As I Have Life, Oh Lover

1352
02:46:35,418 --> 02:46:39,320
I Will Dance

1353
02:47:30,840 --> 02:47:35,004
Love Never Dies

1354
02:47:35,111 --> 02:47:38,569
It Doesn't Even Fear Death

1355
02:47:51,127 --> 02:47:55,188
We Will Be Robbed, Ruined,
And We Will Die

1356
02:47:55,398 --> 02:48:00,563
But Our Story Will Stay Alive

1357
02:48:49,586 --> 02:48:53,323
If My Anklet Breaks, So What?

1358
02:48:53,323 --> 02:48:57,282
If My Legs Become Wounded, So What?

1359
02:49:09,372 --> 02:49:13,343
Having Given My Heart, Taken A Heart,
Fallen In Love, So

1360
02:49:13,343 --> 02:49:18,542
I Have To Give Love's Test

1361
02:50:28,451 --> 02:50:32,755
These Eyes Cannot Be Cast Down

1362
02:50:32,755 --> 02:50:36,247
This Voice Cannot Be Stopped

1363
02:50:51,708 --> 02:50:55,804
I Will Speak, I Will Bear Pain,
Why Should I Stay Silent?

1364
02:50:55,979 --> 02:51:01,383
I Am Out Of Control But
I Am Not Speechless

1365
02:51:45,361 --> 02:51:48,262
If anyone dare moves,
he's gonna be dead meat!

1366
02:51:51,668 --> 02:51:55,434
Gabbar Singh! Ask your men
to drop their guns!

1367
02:52:00,510 --> 02:52:01,807
Go on

1368
02:53:23,526 --> 02:53:25,756
Go after them! Go on!

1369
02:53:26,763 --> 02:53:29,254
And don't return empty-handed,
you bastards!

1370
02:53:31,067 --> 02:53:32,227
Hurry up!

1371
02:55:04,927 --> 02:55:07,259
Jai! Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm okay.

1372
02:55:10,533 --> 02:55:13,991
The three of us can't escape
on a single horse, Veeru.

1373
02:55:14,604 --> 02:55:18,335
Take Basanti away to the village
and return soon.

1374
02:55:18,908 --> 02:55:21,433
And bring lots of ammunition
when you return.

1375
02:55:24,480 --> 02:55:28,109
No! I will stay here!
Take Basanti and leave quickly!

1376
02:55:29,252 --> 02:55:32,847
Listen to me, Veeru!
Take Basanti away! I'll stay here.

1377
02:55:33,122 --> 02:55:35,420
No, Jai! I can't leave you alone.

1378
02:55:36,192 --> 02:55:38,217
One of us will have to go, Veeru.

1379
02:55:38,494 --> 02:55:41,292
Or else, we'll soon
run out of bullets.

1380
02:55:42,198 --> 02:55:45,258
Well, all right.
Let's toss instead.

1381
02:55:46,369 --> 02:55:49,065
If it's Heads, I stay back.
If it's Tails, you hold fort.

1382
02:55:53,075 --> 02:55:54,303
I win!

1383
02:55:58,714 --> 02:56:00,909
But how can you be...
- No more arguments, Veeru!

1384
02:56:01,217 --> 02:56:04,015
Leave your gun and bullets behind.
And take Basanti out quickly! Go on!

1385
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:13,354
I somehow don't feel like
leaving you alone, Jai.

1386
02:56:14,230 --> 02:56:16,892
Take care, okay?
- Sure.

1387
03:00:14,336 --> 03:00:16,304
There's just one bullet!

1388
03:01:23,873 --> 03:01:27,707
Are you okay, Jai?!
- Yes... I'm okay.

1389
03:01:29,812 --> 03:01:32,872
I've killed every
single bastard before...

1390
03:01:35,651 --> 03:01:38,085
Don't worry, Jai!
Just don't be scared!

1391
03:01:39,154 --> 03:01:42,180
Why must I be scared when
you're with me, Veeru?

1392
03:01:43,292 --> 03:01:46,557
Let's return to our village!
Everything will be all right!

1393
03:01:46,829 --> 03:01:49,821
My game is up, Veeru.

1394
03:01:50,132 --> 03:01:52,225
It's all over...
- No!

1395
03:01:52,868 --> 03:01:55,860
No, Jai! Don't say such things!

1396
03:01:56,939 --> 03:02:00,568
But I have no regrets, Veeru.

1397
03:02:01,210 --> 03:02:05,169
I have lived for my friend...
and am dying before him!

1398
03:02:06,015 --> 03:02:09,007
But there is something
I'm leaving unfinished, Veeru.

1399
03:02:09,818 --> 03:02:11,809
I won't be able to tell
stories to your children.

1400
03:02:12,054 --> 03:02:14,955
You're going to be all right, Jai!
Nothing will happen to you!

1401
03:02:15,257 --> 03:02:20,854
But you must tell your children
tales of our friendship and exploits.

1402
03:02:21,931 --> 03:02:24,297
You won't forget that, will you?
- What nonsense are you talking?!

1403
03:02:30,205 --> 03:02:31,900
Look there, Veeru...

1404
03:02:38,180 --> 03:02:40,705
There's yet another
incomplete story, Veeru.

1405
03:02:41,817 --> 03:02:44,843
What had I dreamed of;
and what has come to be?

1406
03:02:46,055 --> 03:02:51,083
No, Jai!
You can't leave me like this!

1407
03:02:55,264 --> 03:02:56,356
No!

1408
03:02:57,399 --> 03:03:01,096
No, Jai! Please don't!

1409
03:03:03,739 --> 03:03:07,835
No, Jai!
You can't do this to me!

1410
03:03:59,628 --> 03:04:04,463
What you have done?

1411
03:04:04,633 --> 03:04:08,569
You betrayed me

1412
03:04:09,438 --> 03:04:14,432
and broke your promise

1413
03:04:16,912 --> 03:04:21,246
You walked away

1414
03:04:21,450 --> 03:04:33,385
leaving me behind lonely

1415
03:04:33,729 --> 03:04:37,187
you moved on

1416
03:04:39,601 --> 03:04:43,765
you've changed my friend

1417
03:04:46,542 --> 03:04:50,842
and broke our friendship

1418
03:04:52,681 --> 03:05:06,789
We Will Not Break This Friendship

1419
03:05:08,697 --> 03:05:20,541
I May Break My Strength,
But I Will Not Leave Your Side

1420
03:05:47,302 --> 03:05:54,037
Jai! You have cheated me
to save my life?

1421
03:05:59,915 --> 03:06:02,975
I swear upon the blood
that you have shed!

1422
03:06:03,252 --> 03:06:08,315
I will pick and choose each
one of them, and give them death!

1423
03:06:09,224 --> 03:06:12,455
Gabbar Singh!
I'm coming after you!

1424
03:07:15,057 --> 03:07:18,151
Gabbar! Come out in the open!

1425
03:07:19,294 --> 03:07:21,660
Face me like a man,
you bastard!

1426
03:07:22,331 --> 03:07:26,461
I've come to avenge every drop
of blood that my friend has shed!

1427
03:07:27,502 --> 03:07:30,437
You can't escape death today!

1428
03:09:07,936 --> 03:09:10,564
Hand him over to me, Veeru.

1429
03:09:11,039 --> 03:09:15,840
No, Thakur! I'm not going to
let this bastard live anymore!

1430
03:09:16,411 --> 03:09:19,903
Don't forget your promise, Veeru!
- I don't remember anything!

1431
03:09:20,549 --> 03:09:24,986
All I know is that this bastard's
men have killed my friend!

1432
03:09:25,787 --> 03:09:28,085
And I'm going to have
his blood for that!

1433
03:09:28,557 --> 03:09:32,049
It was that very friend of yours
who had made a promise to me.

1434
03:09:34,396 --> 03:09:36,523
Leave him alone.

1435
03:09:46,742 --> 03:09:53,147
I wish it was I who had made the
promise; I'd have broken it today!

1436
03:09:54,449 --> 03:09:57,509
But it was my friend
who gave you his word.

1437
03:09:58,053 --> 03:09:59,111
So...

1438
03:10:45,567 --> 03:10:52,439
You can't fight me, Thakur!
I've already cut your arms!

1439
03:10:53,875 --> 03:10:58,938
One uses his feet, not his hands,
to crush the snake, Gabbar!

1440
03:11:01,750 --> 03:11:04,082
My feet are enough
to deal with you!

1441
03:11:26,708 --> 03:11:29,199
Your arms are full of
strength, aren't they?

1442
03:12:27,903 --> 03:12:32,274
Gabbar! Give your hands to me!

1443
03:12:32,274 --> 03:12:33,605
No!

1444
03:12:33,909 --> 03:12:36,002
Give me this hand, Gabbar!

1445
03:12:36,745 --> 03:12:37,837
No!

1446
03:13:56,925 --> 03:13:57,914
Thakur...

1447
03:14:00,028 --> 03:14:01,655
Leave him alone.

1448
03:14:04,232 --> 03:14:07,099
To punish the criminal
is the duty of the law.

1449
03:14:08,403 --> 03:14:11,668
The law wants Gabbar...

1450
03:14:12,307 --> 03:14:13,740
alive...

1451
03:14:15,410 --> 03:14:16,843
or dead.

1452
03:14:17,045 --> 03:14:21,004
Have your emotions become more
important than your duty and the law?

1453
03:14:24,386 --> 03:14:27,219
Do law and justice no longer merit
the same status in your esteem...?

1454
03:14:34,262 --> 03:14:36,730
I know what you have been through.

1455
03:14:37,365 --> 03:14:40,857
But don't forget,
you have been a police officer...

1456
03:14:41,136 --> 03:14:42,933
who's still an example
for others.

1457
03:16:23,037 --> 03:16:25,232
Well, Thakur...
I must leave now.

1458
03:16:30,345 --> 03:16:34,441
I know I can't share your grief.
But I do understand.
