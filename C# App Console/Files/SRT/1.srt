<i>...in the Underground Realm,
where there are no lies or pain,...</i>

<i>Once outside...</i>

Why did you bring
so many books, Ofelia?

24
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,310
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

25
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,490
Fairy tales?

26
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,990
You're a bit too old to be
filling your head with such nonsense.

27
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,970
Ask him to stop the car.

28
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,950
Ofelia, wait.

29
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,250
Your brother's not well.

30
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,020
Madam, are you okay?

31
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,830
Ofelia?

32
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,130
Ofelia, Come here.

33
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,570
- I saw a fairy.
- Just look at your shoes!

34
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,800
Let's go.

35
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,850
When we get to the mill,
come out to greet the Captain.

36
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,910
I want you to call him Father.

37
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,790
You have no idea
how good he's been to us.

38
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,490
It's just a word, Ofelia.
Just a word.

39
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,150
They're coming, Captain.

40
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,640
15 minutes late.

41
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,770
Carmen.

42
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,550
Welcome.

43
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,790
That's not necessary.
I can walk perfectly well.

44
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,730
Doctor Ferreiro prefers
that you don't exert yourself.

45
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,290
No.

46
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,330
Come.
Do it for me.

47
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,600
Thank you.

48
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,630
Ofelia, come out.

49
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,740
Say hello to the Captain.

50
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,840
Ofelia.

51
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,190
It's the other hand, Ofelia.

52
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,160
Mercedes!

53
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,270
- Bring the luggage.
- Sir.

54
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,530
It's a labyrinth.

55
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,600
Just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here.

56
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,900
Even before the mill.

57
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,910
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

58
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,740
Thank you.

59
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,620
Have you read them all?

60
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,050
Mercedes!

61
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,150
The Captain is calling.

62
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,820
Your father needs me.

63
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,890
He's not my father.

64
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,320
The Captain is not my father.

65
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,830
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

66
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,300
He's not my father.

67
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,140
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

68
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,640
Have you seen my mother?

69
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,700
- Isn't she beautiful!
- Yes.

70
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,510
She's sick with baby.
Did you notice?

71
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,170
The guerrillas are sticking
to the woods...

72
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,270
...because it's hard
to track them up there.

73
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,740
Those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us.

74
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,570
We'll block all access
to the woods.

75
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,010
Food, medicine...
We'll store it all. Right here.

76
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,080
We need to force them down,
make them come to us.

77
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,150
We'll set up three
new command posts.

78
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,920
Here, here and here.

79
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,120
Mercedes.

80
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,920
- Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.
- Yes, sir.

81
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,730
This will help you sleep
through the night.

82
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,530
Just two drops just before bed.

83
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,870
Two drops only.

84
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,240
Very good.

85
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,410
All of it.
Good.

86
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,380
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need anything. Day or night.

87
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,020
You or your nurse.

88
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,820
Good night.

89
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,360
Close the door
and turn off the lights, sweetie.

90
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,510
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.

91
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,980
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.

92
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,920
This is all I could get.

93
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,150
I'm sorry.

94
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,050
Captain Vidal is waiting
for you in his office.

95
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,560
Come here, Ofelia.

96
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,000
Jesus, your feet.
They're frozen!

97
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,010
Are you afraid?

98
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,240
A little.

99
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,450
What's that noise?

100
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,650
Nothing, just the wind.

101
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,330
Nights here are different
from city nights.

102
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,290
There, you hear cars-tramway.

103
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,700
Here the houses are old.

104
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,460
They creak.

105
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,410
As if they were speaking.

106
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,890
Tomorrow, I'm going
to give you a surprise.

107
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,250
- A surprise?
- Yes.

108
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,230
- A book?
- No, something much better.

109
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,170
Why did you have to get married?

110
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,740
I was alone too long.

111
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,470
I'm with you.
You weren't alone.

112
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,000
You were never alone.

113
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,220
When you're older, you'll understand.
It hasn't been easy for me either.

114
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,790
Your brother's at it again.

115
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,790
Tell him one of your stories.

116
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,030
I'm sure that'll calm down.

117
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,490
My brother, my brother.

118
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,110
Many, many years ago,...

119
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,850
<i>...in a sad, faraway land,...</i>

120
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,680
<i>...there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.</i>

121
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,020
<i>At sunset,...</i>

122
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,950
<i>...on top of that mountain,...</i>

123
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,630
<i>...a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal.</i>

124
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,400
<i>But no one dared go near it,...</i>

125
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,030
<i>...because its thorns were full of poison.</i>

126
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,840
<i>Men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death,...</i>

127
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,550
<i>...and pain, but never about
the promise of eternal life.</i>

128
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:13,470
<i>And every day, the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.</i>

129
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,930
<i>forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain,...</i>

130
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,670
<i>...forever alone,
until the end of time.</i>

131
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,520
Come in.

132
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,830
- How is she?
- Very weak.

133
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,800
She'll have as much rest
as she needs.

134
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,090
I'll sleep down here.

135
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,760
- And my son?
- Pardon?

136
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,910
Excuse us, Captain.

137
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,000
My son, how is he?

138
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,680
For the moment, there's no
reason to be alarmed.

139
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,780
Very good.

140
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,680
Captain, your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy.

141
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,630
- Is that your opinion?
- My professional opinion, yes, sir.

142
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,240
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

143
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,760
That's all.

144
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,710
One more thing, Captain.

145
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,740
What makes you so sure
the baby is a male?

146
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,020
Don't fuck with me.

147
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,480
At 8 o'clock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector.

148
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,980
Gunfire.

149
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,290
Sergeant Bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect.

150
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,990
The other one's his son,
here from the town.

151
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,470
Captain, my father
is an honest man.

152
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,590
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.

153
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,270
We found this weapon on him.
It's been fired.

154
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,170
My father was hunting
rabbits, Captain.

155
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,800
Again, keep quiet.

156
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,150
"No God, no country, no Master"?

157
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,750
- Just like that-how do you like that?
- Red propaganda, Captain.

158
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,690
It's not propaganda, sir.

159
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,700
It's an old almanac, Captain.

160
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,400
We're just farmers.

161
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,830
Go on.

162
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,840
I went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.

163
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,600
For my daughters.
They're sick.

164
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,680
Rabbits, uh?

165
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,880
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

166
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,960
Leave him alone.

167
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,170
You killed him,
You killed him!

168
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,670
Murderer!
Son of a bitch!

169
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,600
Maybe you'll learn to search
these assholes properly...

170
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,430
...before you come bothering me.

171
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,870
Yes, Captain.

172
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,570
Mother.
Mother, wake up!

173
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,330
Mother, there's something in the room.

174
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,680
Hello.

175
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,070
Did you follow me here?

176
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,010
Are you a fairy?

177
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,350
Look!

178
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,180
This is a fairy.

179
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,650
You want me to go with you?

180
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,690
Outside?
Where?

181
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,370
Hello?

182
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,270
Hello?

183
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,420
Echo.

184
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,460
Echo.

185
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,440
Hello?

186
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,810
Hello?

187
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,720
It's you.

188
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,190
It's you.
You've returned.

189
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,320
Don't be frightened, I beg you.

190
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,600
Look, look.

191
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,500
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?

192
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,810
Me?

193
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,850
I've had so many names.

194
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:26,050
Old names that only the wind
and the trees can pronounce.

195
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:33,070
I am the mountain,
the forest and the earth.

196
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,170
I am...

197
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,440
I am a faun.

198
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:46,240
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

199
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,010
- No, I'm...
- You're Princess Moanna,...

200
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,780
...daughter of the King
of the underworld.

201
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,590
My father was a tailor.

202
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,820
You are not born of man.

203
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,300
It was the moon that bore you.

204
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,760
Look on your left shoulder...

205
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,900
...and you will find a mark
that proves it.

206
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:19,300
Your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return.

207
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,440
This is...

208
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,680
This is the last of them.

209
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:33,920
But we have to make sure
that your essence is intact,...

210
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:38,560
...that you have not become a mortal.

211
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:47,770
You must complete three tasks
before the moon is full.

212
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:56,740
This is The Book of Crossroads.

213
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:00,580
Open it, when you are alone...

214
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,620
...and it will show you your future,...

215
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,060
...show you what must be done.

216
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,000
But there's nothing in here.

217
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,520
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight.

218
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,560
They are too young.

219
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,130
- Well, maybe they'll do for a stew.
- Yes, sir.

220
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,600
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.

221
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,890
You should keep an eye on it.

222
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,120
As you wish, sir.

223
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,650
Cook these.

224
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,900
- He didn't like the coffee.
- He's nothing but a fussy dandy.

225
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,905
A fussy dandy!

226
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,205
We're going to need some beef
and one more chicken.

227
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,070
- Where are we supposed to find that?
- The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

228
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,140
Well, they eat more
than a couple of pigs.

229
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,810
- And they don't shut up.
- Not even underwater.

230
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,790
I'll be back in a moment,
Mercedes.

231
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,170
Ofelia.

232
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,480
Your father is giving
a dinner party tonight.

233
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,710
Look what I've made for you.

234
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,350
Do you like it?

235
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,150
What I wouldn't have given
to have such a dress...

236
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,730
...as fine as this when I was your age!

237
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:55,020
And look at the shoes!

238
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,090
- Do you like them?
- Yes, very pretty.

239
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,400
Go on, now.
Take your bath.

240
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,850
<b><font color="#00ff00">TREE</font></b>

241
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,150
<b><font color="#ffff00">Once upon a time,
when the forest was young</font></b>

242
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,650
<b><font color="#ffff00">they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder</font></b>

243
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,150
<b><font color="#ffff00">They protected one another and slept
in the shade of a colossal fig tree</font></b>

244
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,250
<b><font color="#ffff00">that grew on a hill, near the mill</font></b>

245
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,250
<b><font color="#ffff00">But now, the tree is dying</font></b>

246
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,060
Ofelia?

247
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,400
Ofelia?

248
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,300
Hurry up.
I want to see the dress on you.

249
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,140
I want you to be beautiful
for the Captain.

250
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,740
You'll look like a Princess.

251
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,550
A Princess?

252
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,620
Make sure those chickens
are cleaned properly.

253
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,200
And don't forget the beans.

254
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,810
- You look marvelous, my girl, just beautiful.
- What a gorgeous dress!

255
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,730
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

256
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,020
Do you want some milk with honey?

257
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,510
Move back, we can't have you getting
milk on your dress, with you looking so pretty.

258
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,830
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?

259
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,860
No.

260
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,030
But when I was a little girl,
I did.

261
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,700
I believed in a lot of things
I don't believe any more.

262
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,840
Last night,
a fairy visited me.

263
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,900
Really?

264
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,280
And it wasn't alone,
there were lots of them,...

265
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:30,980
- ...and a faun, too.
- A faun?

266
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,210
He was very old, very tall
and smelled like earth.

267
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,280
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

268
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,580
Mercedes!

269
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,500
Come with me.

270
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,970
Captain,
everything is here.

271
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,910
Flour, salt, oil, medicine,...

272
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,210
...olives, bacon.

273
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,180
This-this is real tobacco.

274
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,550
And the ration cards.

275
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,250
- I need you to check the inventory.
- Very well.

276
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,750
Mercedes.

277
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,660
- The key.
- Yes, sir.

278
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,940
- Is this the only copy?
- The only one.

279
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,840
From now on, I'll carry it.

280
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,710
Captain.

281
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,080
Captain,
perhaps it's nothing.

282
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,480
It's them.

283
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,230
<i>"Once upon a time,
when the forest was young,..."</i>

284
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:09,440
<i>"...they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder."</i>

285
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,590
<i>"They protected one another,..."</i>

286
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,060
<i>"...and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree..."</i>

287
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,930
<i>...that grew on a hill, near the mill."</i>

288
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,230
<i>"But now, the tree is dying."</i>

289
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,230
<i>"Its branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted."</i>

290
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,270
<i>"A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots..."</i>

291
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,010
<i>"...and won't let the tree thrive."</i>

292
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:43,510
<i>"You must put the three magic
stones in the toad's mouth..."</i>

293
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,640
<i>"...and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly."</i>

294
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,420
<i>"Only then will the fig tree
flourish again."</i>

295
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,740
They were here
less than twenty minutes ago.

296
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,380
They left in a hurry.

297
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,420
A dozen men, at most.

298
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,710
Antibiotics.

299
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,840
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

300
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,380
They're here.

301
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,720
Those sons of bitches are here...

302
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,720
...and they're watching us.

303
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,370
Hey!

304
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,200
You left this behind!

305
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,940
And your lottery ticket!

306
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,570
Why don't you come back
and get it?

307
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,780
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

308
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,480
Hello.
I'm Princess Moanna,...

309
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,330
...and I'm not afraid of you.

310
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,030
Aren't you ashamed
living down here,...

311
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,260
...eating all these bugs...

312
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,970
...and growing fat
while the tree dies?

313
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,550
Hey!

314
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,900
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry?

315
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,300
Yes, ma'am.

316
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,500
Have you checked the garden?

317
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,640
- And the barn?
- Yes, ma'am.

318
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,070
Where is that girl?

319
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,450
This way, please.

320
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:02,480
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

321
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,220
- Charmed.
- A pleasure to meet you.

322
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,130
From now on,
one ration card per family.

323
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,860
Take a look.

324
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,190
- One?
- Only one.

325
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,770
Captain, I'm not sure
it'll be enough.

326
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,170
If people are careful,
it should be plenty.

327
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,440
We can't allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains.

328
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:25,440
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

329
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,050
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

330
00:39:29,085 --> 00:39:31,780
We almost got them.
We found this.

331
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,810
Antibiotics.

332
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,420
God has already
saved their souls.

333
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,320
What happens to their bodies
hardly matter to Him.

334
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,980
We'll help however we can, Captain.

335
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,260
We know you're not here by choice.

336
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,690
You're wrong about that.

337
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:55,770
I choose to be here because I want
my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.

338
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,840
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief...

339
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,670
...that we're all equal.

340
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,750
But there's a big difference:

341
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,880
The war is over and we won.

342
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,420
And if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it,...

343
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,590
...then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

344
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,350
We're all here by choice.

345
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,560
By choice!

346
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,270
Put the coffee on.
I'm going for more wood.

347
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,400
We'll take care of it.

348
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,530
Ofelia?

349
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,410
So, how did you
and the Captain meet?

350
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,650
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

351
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,760
Oh, I see.

352
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,490
And after he died,
I went to work at the shop.

353
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,820
A little more than a year ago,...

354
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:28,530
...the Captain and I met again.

355
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,190
Curious, isn't it!

356
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:33,440
I mean, finding each other again?

357
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:37,640
Oh, yes,
very, very curious.

358
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,610
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.

359
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,350
She thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others.

360
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,040
We understand.

361
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,620
Excuse me, madam
Ofelia is here.

362
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,760
Excuse me.

363
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,900
Have I told you that I was acquainted
with your father, Captain?

364
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,540
No.
I had no idea.

365
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,770
In Morocco.

366
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,150
I knew him only briefly,
but he left a great impression.

367
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,410
An excellent soldier.

368
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:23,190
The men in his battalion said that
when General Vidal died on the battlefield,...

369
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,650
...he smashed his watch on a rock...

370
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,350
...so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death.

371
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,790
So he would know
how a brave man dies.

372
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:37,390
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.

373
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,200
What you've done hurts me.

374
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,340
After your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

375
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:49,440
Are you listening?

376
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,680
Sometimes I think
you'll never learn to behave.

377
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,550
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

378
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,030
And your father, too.

379
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,760
You mean the Captain?

380
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,200
Him more than me.

381
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,080
I've got the key.

382
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,450
Take me to the Labyrinth.

383
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:23,700
Hello.

384
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,310
I got the key out.

385
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:33,250
That's me,
and the girl is you.

386
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:34,780
And the baby?

387
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,390
So... you retrieved the key.

388
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,420
I'm glad.

389
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:55,370
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

390
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,440
She's so glad you succeeded.

391
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,880
Keep the key.

392
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,480
You'll be needing it very soon.

393
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:14,560
And this too?
a piece of chalk.

394
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,235
Two tasks remain...

395
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:24,100
...and the moon is almost full.

396
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,000
Be patient.

397
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:34,980
We'll soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace.

398
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,610
How do I know
that what you say is true?

399
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,860
Why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you?

400
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,170
Proceed.

401
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:10,650
Have your cards
ready for inspection.

402
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,440
Let's go.
Your name?

403
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,680
Your names, first and last.

404
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,320
Narciso Pena Soriano,
at your service.

405
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,650
<i>Name?</i>

406
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:29,060
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain,...

407
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,400
...kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie...

408
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,430
...because in a united Spain,...

409
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:39,310
...there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

410
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:57,090
Come on, show me
what happens now?

411
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,620
Show me.

412
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:38,260
Ofelia, help me...

413
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:45,980
Captain! Captain!

414
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,110
Come quickly.

415
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:51,950
...because in a united Spain,...

416
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:55,920
...there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

417
00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:58,720
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

418
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,600
Your wife needs
uninterrupted rest.

419
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:09,370
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

420
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,940
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

421
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,770
I'll stay here until the birth.

422
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,210
Make her well.

423
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,570
I don't care what it costs
or what you need.

424
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:27,980
Make her well.

425
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:50,780
Don't worry.

426
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,440
Your mother will get better soon,
you'll see.

427
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,440
Having a baby is complicated.

428
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,420
Then I'll never have one.

429
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:18,800
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

430
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:31,780
Have you told anyone?

431
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:34,480
No, I haven't.

432
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,780
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

433
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,960
Nor I to you.

434
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,630
Do you know a lullaby?

435
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:57,840
Only one...

436
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:01,000
...but I don't remember the words.

437
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:04,910
I don't care.
I still want to hear it.

438
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:01,030
Don't be afraid.
It's only me.

439
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,950
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

440
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,250
Then let's go.

441
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:20,730
This is sheer madness.

442
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,530
When that man finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

443
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:27,160
- Have you thought about that?
- Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?

444
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:29,530
It's not fear...

445
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,500
...at least not for myself.

446
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,680
Pedro!

447
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,420
Pedro, My brother!

448
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:06,230
You didn't carry out the task.

449
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:09,670
No, my mother is sick.

450
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:13,800
That's no excuse
for negligence.

451
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:18,950
Look.
This is a mandrake root.

452
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:22,920
A plant that dreamt
of being human.

453
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:28,520
Put it under your mother's bed...

454
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:32,130
...in a bowl of fresh milk.

455
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:37,690
Each morning,
give it two drops of blood.

456
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:42,200
Now, we have no time
to waste.

457
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:45,270
The full moon will be upon us.

458
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:50,110
Take my pets
to guide you through.

459
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:56,310
You're going to a very dangerous
place, so be careful.

460
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,290
The thing that slumbers there,...

461
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,720
...it is not human.

462
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:13,730
You will see a sumptuous feast,
but don't eat or drink anything.

463
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,670
Absolutely nothing.

464
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:23,870
Your life depends on it.

465
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:49,500
I've brought some Orujo,
tobacco, cheese.

466
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,580
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

467
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:56,620
Let's see how that leg's doing, Frenchie.

468
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:00,620
How do you think it's doing?
It's fucked up.

469
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:02,680
Let's see.

470
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,020
...N-North American,...

471
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,060
...British and Canadian troops...

472
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:16,690
...disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F.

473
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,230
- "France", idiot.
- F-f-f-rance.

474
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,130
More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope...

475
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:28,180
...under the command
of General Dwight D. Eisenhower...

476
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,350
Is it really bad, doctor?

477
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,010
Look, Frenchie.

478
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,850
There's no way to save it.

479
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:52,030
I'll try to make it
in as few cuts as possible.

480
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:03,210
Wait a second, doctor,
just a second.

481
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:44,480
<i>"Use the chalk to trace a door

00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:53,620
<i>"Once the door's open,
start the hourglass."</i>

483
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:58,060
<i>"Let the fairies guide you."</i>

484
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,780
<i>"Don't eat or drink anything,
during your stay,..."</i>

485
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:11,570
<i>"...and come back
before the last grain of sand falls."</i>

486
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:21,570
No.

487
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,610
This other one.

488
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:03,130
No! No!

489
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:20,850
We'll soon have reinforcements
from Jaca.

490
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:25,190
Fifty men or more.
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.

491
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,720
And then what?

492
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:33,120
You kill him, they'll send another
just like him. And another...

493
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,930
You're screwed, no guns,
no safe shelter...

494
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:41,270
You need food, medicine.
You must take care of Mercedes.

495
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:43,240
If you really love her,
you'd cross the border with her.

496
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:45,740
- This is a lost cause.
- I'm staying here, doctor.

497
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,040
There's no choice.

498
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:00,620
You have to leave.

499
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:05,330
Here's the key,
but you can't go down there now.

500
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,830
It's exactly what he expects.

501
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:11,970
Leave it to me.

502
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,170
I'm a coward.

503
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,800
No, you're not.

504
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,210
Yes, I am.

505
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:28,290
A coward... for living
next to that son of a bitch,...

506
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:32,390
...doing his laundry, making his bed,
feeding him.

507
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,590
What if the doctor's right
and we can't win?

508
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,130
At least we'll make things
harder for that bastard.

509
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:40,990
Captain Vidal.

510
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:45,610
Her temperature's down.
I don't know how, but it is.

511
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,360
But she still has a fever?

512
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:50,890
Yes, but it's a good sign.
Her body is responding.

513
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,660
Listen to me.

514
01:05:54,330 --> 01:05:57,360
If you have to choose,
save the baby.

515
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:00,060
That boy will bear my name
and my father's name.

516
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:01,190
Save him.

517
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:38,180
Brother.

518
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:41,110
Little brother...

519
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:44,870
If you can hear me,...

520
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:48,150
...things out here aren't too good.

521
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,010
But soon you'll have to come out.

522
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:54,920
You've made Mama very sick.

523
01:06:57,130 --> 01:07:00,760
I want to ask you one favor
for when you come out,...

524
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:03,030
...just one:

525
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:06,030
don't hurt her.

526
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,470
You'll meet her,
she's very pretty,...

527
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:13,570
...even though sometimes
she's sad for days at a time.

528
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,540
You'll see, when she smiles,...

529
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:19,640
...you'll love her.

530
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:25,320
Listen, if you do what I say,...

531
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:27,180
...I'll make you a promise,...

532
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:31,760
...I'll take you to my kingdom,
and I'll make you a prince.

533
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,930
I promise you, a prince.

534
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:05,120
I sounded the whistle,
but they wouldn't move.

535
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:07,730
I tried to stop, but it was too late.

536
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,230
The fireman and I
jumped out just in time,...

537
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:11,870
...but look at the mess they made.

538
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,770
What did they steal
from the freight cars?

539
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,070
They didn't open a single one.

540
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,780
What the hell are you talking about?

541
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:23,210
This whole mess.
They didn't open any of the cars.

542
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:27,710
- They didn't take anything.
- Nothing? Are you sure?

543
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:31,950
God only knows what they wanted,
other than to waste our time.

544
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:50,570
They came out of nowhere, Captain.

545
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:57,080
They have grenades,
they went up hill.

546
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:04,580
Captain, we've surrounded
a small unit that fell behind.

547
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,410
They took cover up on the hill.

548
01:09:41,490 --> 01:09:45,990
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid,
this is the only decent way to die.

549
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:30,900
Serrano!

550
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:51,150
Let me see.
Let me see.

551
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:56,990
Can you talk?

552
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:02,370
Damn it!

553
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,550
These are useless! They can't talk.

554
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:35,530
Captain,
this one's still alive.

555
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:40,980
Shot in the leg.

556
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:48,280
- What's happened?
- They caught one.

557
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:50,750
They took one of them alive.
And they're taking him to the storeroom.

558
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:57,090
Mercedes!

559
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:00,160
Pedro... Pedro...

560
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:18,580
Mercedes?

561
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,510
- I need to get into the storeroom.
- Not now.

562
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:24,350
Move away!

563
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,680
That's plenty, dear.

564
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,750
Should I take this up?

565
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:21,080
Here, half the dose.

566
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,380
I don't think I need it.

567
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,670
I feel better, much better.

568
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:29,350
I don't understand.
But I'm glad.

569
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:33,280
Mother...

570
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,800
Damn, this cigarette is good!

571
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:54,980
Real tobacco hard to find.

572
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:59,010
G- G-Go to hell.

573
01:14:01,690 --> 01:14:05,680
Damn, Garces. We catch one
and he turns out to be a stutterer.

574
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,080
We'll be here all night.

575
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:10,260
As long as he talks.

576
01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:17,960
Garces is right.

577
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,100
You'd do better
to tell us everything.

578
01:14:21,810 --> 01:14:25,170
But to make sure it happens,
I brought along a few tools.

579
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:29,710
Just things you pick up
along the way.

580
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:32,350
At first,
I won't be able to trust you,...

581
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:36,380
...but after I use this,
you'll own up to a few things.

582
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:39,890
When we get to these,...

583
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:44,590
...we'll have developed...
How can I put this...?

584
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,590
A closer bond,
much like brothers.

585
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:50,560
You'll see.

586
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:54,230
And when we get to this one,...

587
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:58,040
...I'll believe anything you tell me.

588
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:11,650
I'll make you a deal.

589
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:15,250
If you can count to three
without st-t-tuttering,...

590
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:16,790
...you can go.

591
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,900
Don't look at him, look at me.

592
01:15:22,170 --> 01:15:23,930
Above me, there's no one.

593
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:26,370
- Garces!
- Yes, Captain?

594
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,160
If I say this asshole can leave,
would anybody contradict me?

595
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,870
No one, Captain.
He can leave.

596
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:36,740
There you have it.
Count to three.

597
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:55,760
- One.
- Good.

598
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:00,970
Two.

599
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:05,640
One more and you will be free.

600
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,530
Shame.

601
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:39,470
Your mother is much better,
Your Highness.

602
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:46,980
Surely, you must be relieved.

603
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:49,580
Yes, thank you.

604
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:53,450
But things haven't turned out so well.

605
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,450
No?

606
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:00,890
- I had an accident.
- An accident?

607
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:02,030
Yes.

608
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:14,210
- You broke the rules!
- It was only two grapes!

609
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:15,900
I thought no one would notice.

610
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:20,410
- We've made a mistake!
- A mistake?

611
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:24,880
You failed.
You can never return.

612
01:17:24,990 --> 01:17:28,650
- It was an accident!
- You cannot return.

613
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:32,720
The moon will be full in three days.

614
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:39,000
Your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans.

615
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:42,970
You shall age like them,
you shall die like them...

616
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:47,140
...and all memory of you
shall fade in time.

617
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:51,710
And we'll vanish along with it.

618
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:56,150
You will never see us again.

619
01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:10,600
Good day, doctor.
Sorry to wake you so early,...

620
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,060
...but I think we need your help.

621
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:37,950
My God, what have you done to him?

622
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:39,260
Not much.

623
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,000
But things are getting better.

624
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:55,640
I like having you handy, Doctor.
It has its advantages.

625
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,650
Serrano, stay here.

626
01:18:58,820 --> 01:18:59,870
I talked.

627
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:02,510
Not much.

628
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:08,330
- B-b-but I talked.
- I'm sorry.

629
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:10,650
I'm so sorry.

630
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:22,930
Kill me.
Kill me now, please.

631
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,720
Son of a bitch.

632
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,750
It'll take away the pain.

633
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,590
It's almost over.

634
01:20:20,330 --> 01:20:21,660
Watch Dr. Ferreiro,...

635
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,270
- ...I'll be right there.
- {\i1}Yes, Captain.{\i0}

636
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:48,420
You're not moving anymore.

637
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:51,360
Are you sick?

638
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:57,090
What are you doing down there?

639
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:12,340
- Call him!
- Who?

640
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,850
Who else, you imbecile?
Ferreiro!

641
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:41,040
What the hell is this?

642
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:45,710
No! No, no!

643
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:49,550
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!

644
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,820
Look at this! Look what she
was hiding under your bed!

645
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:55,420
What do you think of this?

646
01:22:00,030 --> 01:22:04,520
Ofelia, what is this thing doing
under the bed?

647
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:08,670
It's a magic root
the faun gave me.

648
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:11,430
This is all because of that junk
you let her read.

649
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:12,740
Look what you've done!

650
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,940
Please, leave us alone.
I'll talk to her, darling.

651
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:20,520
Fine.
As you wish.

652
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,020
He told me you would get better.
And you did.

653
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:28,190
Ofelia, you have to listen
to your father.

654
01:22:29,530 --> 01:22:30,620
You have to stop all this.

655
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,920
No. I want to leave this place!

656
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:37,430
Please, take me away from here!
Let's just go, Please!

657
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:39,870
Things are not that simple.

658
01:22:42,110 --> 01:22:43,940
You're getting older,...

659
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:48,340
...soon you'll see that life
isn't like your fairy tales.

660
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:51,140
The world is a cruel place.

661
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:56,250
And you'll learn that,
even if it hurts.

662
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:00,380
- No! No!
- Ofelia!

663
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:06,690
Magic does not exist.
Not for you, me or anyone else.

664
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:20,770
Mom! Help!

665
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:22,680
Help!

666
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:24,810
Help!

667
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:31,820
Why did you do it?

668
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,820
It was the only thing I could do.

669
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,390
No. You could have obeyed me.

670
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:43,430
I could have, but I didn't.

671
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:47,890
It would have been better for you.
You know it.

672
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:52,280
I don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?

673
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:58,710
To obey-just like that-for the sake
of obeying, without questioning...

674
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:03,440
...that's something only people
like you can do, Captain.

675
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:42,220
Captain!

676
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:50,900
Garces! Call the troop paramedic.

677
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,590
- Get up immediately!
- Yes, Captain.

678
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,100
Your wife is dead.

679
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:43,280
<i>Because the paths to the Lord
are inscrutable.</i>

680
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:45,620
<i>Because the essence
of His forgiveness</i>

681
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:49,020
<i>lies in His word
and in His mystery.</i>

682
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:52,890
<i>Because although God
sends us the message,...</i>

683
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:55,660
<i>...it is our task to decipher it.</i>

684
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:58,360
<i>Because when we open our arms...</i>

685
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:03,400
<i>...the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell.</i>

686
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:07,710
<i>Far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory.</i>

687
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:11,980
<i>Because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life.</i>

688
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:15,720
<i>And the state of grace
that we lose when we are born.</i>

689
01:26:17,050 --> 01:26:22,320
<i>Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands.</i>

690
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:28,890
<i>And because it is only
in His physical absence,...</i>

691
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:33,330
<i>...that the place He occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed.</i>

692
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:58,780
You knew Dr. Ferreiro pretty
well, didn't you, Mercedes?

693
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:02,800
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

694
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:08,400
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here... at the mill.

695
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:13,440
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.

696
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:18,720
Mercedes, please.

697
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:29,890
What must you think of me?

698
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,750
You must think that
I'm a monster.

699
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:36,200
It doesn't matter
what someone like me thinks, sir.

700
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:49,280
I want you to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor, please.

701
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:52,740
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.

702
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:57,280
Mercedes,
aren't you forgetting something?

703
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,310
Sir?

704
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:05,260
The key.

705
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,630
I do have the only copy, don't I?

706
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:10,820
Yes, sir.

707
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:16,360
You know, there's an odd detail
that's been bothering me.

708
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:18,640
Maybe it's not important, but...

709
01:28:18,910 --> 01:28:20,500
...the day they broke into
the storehouse,...

710
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:23,080
...with all those grenades
and explosives,...

711
01:28:23,980 --> 01:28:25,470
...the lock itself wasn't forced.

712
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:31,380
As I said, it's probably
not important.

713
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:36,290
Be very careful.

714
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,620
Good night, sir.

715
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:25,240
Ofelia, Ofelia!

716
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:27,530
Ofelia, I'm leaving tonight.

717
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,570
- Where to?
- I can't tell you. I can't tell you...

718
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:34,710
- Take me with you.
- No, no. I can't.

719
01:29:34,820 --> 01:29:37,840
I can't, my child. But I'll come
back for you, I promise.

720
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:39,110
Take me with you.

721
01:30:04,010 --> 01:30:05,310
I heard something.

722
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:13,450
It's nothing, don't worry.

723
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:23,790
Mercedes.

724
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:26,940
Ofelia.

725
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:37,570
How long have
you known about her?

726
01:30:42,990 --> 01:30:44,540
How long have you been
laughing at me?

727
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:45,980
Little bitch!

728
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:48,590
Watch her!

729
01:30:52,060 --> 01:30:53,790
And if anyone tries to get in,...

730
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,360
...kill her first.

731
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:11,650
Dry meat.

732
01:31:15,250 --> 01:31:16,240
Tobacco.

733
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:20,320
If you had asked for it, I would have
given this to you, Mercedes.

734
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:29,760
I want the names of whoever
wrote these letters.

735
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,660
And I want them
in front of me, tomorrow.

736
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:35,060
Yes, Captain.

737
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,410
You can go, Garces.

738
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:42,380
You're sure, Captain?

739
01:31:44,810 --> 01:31:47,580
For God's sake,
she's just a woman.

740
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,720
That's what you've always thought.

741
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:57,690
That's why I was able to get away with it.

742
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:02,590
- I was invisible to you.
- Damn.

743
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:07,230
You've found my weakness:
Pride.

744
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:11,970
But it's your weak points
we're interested in.

745
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:17,280
It's very simple:
You will talk...

746
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:20,010
...and I have to know...

747
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:23,280
...that everything you say is the truth.

748
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:28,790
We have a few things here
strictly for that purpose.

749
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:31,990
Nothing complicated.

750
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:36,360
Things we learn on the job.

751
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:40,440
At first...

752
01:32:57,550 --> 01:33:00,790
I'm not some old man!
Not a wounded prisoner!

753
01:33:00,860 --> 01:33:04,920
Mother Fucker!
Don't you dare touch the girl?

754
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,920
Won't be the first pig I gutted.

755
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:31,510
Look! He let her go.

756
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:35,320
The fuck did you say?

757
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:46,030
Get her!
Come on! Bring her to me!

758
01:33:46,470 --> 01:33:48,300
Bring her to me, damn it!

759
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:49,930
Mount up!

760
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:55,360
It'll be better if you come
with me without struggling.

761
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:58,030
The Captain said that if you behave...

762
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:04,440
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.

763
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:06,370
If anyone's going to kill you...

764
01:35:08,490 --> 01:35:09,680
...I'd rather it be me.

765
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:24,990
I've decided to give you
one last chance.

766
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:31,960
Do you promise to do what I say?

767
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:38,200
Will you do everything I tell you,
without question?

768
01:36:40,010 --> 01:36:42,980
This is your last chance.

769
01:36:44,110 --> 01:36:47,240
Then listen to me.

770
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:50,080
Fetch your brother...

771
01:36:50,490 --> 01:36:53,150
...and bring him to the labyrinth,...

772
01:36:53,290 --> 01:36:57,690
...as quickly as you can, Your Highness.

773
01:36:57,930 --> 01:36:59,260
My brother?

774
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,830
We need him.

775
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,020
- But...
- No more questions.

776
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:08,590
The door's locked.

777
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:15,510
In that case,
create your own door.

778
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:05,580
Captain, with your permission.

779
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:09,980
Come quickly.

780
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:14,020
- Now what?
- Serrano is back. He's wounded.

781
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:16,360
Wounded?

782
01:41:02,570 --> 01:41:03,970
Where's Garces?

783
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:12,440
How many were there?

784
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:15,210
I don't know exactly, Captain.

785
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:17,140
Fifty men, at least.

786
01:41:17,250 --> 01:41:20,850
The rest of the men didn't make it.
Our watch posts are not responding.

787
01:41:20,990 --> 01:41:24,590
- How many men we have left?
- Twenty, maybe less, sir.

788
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:38,770
We're leaving.
Together.

789
01:41:39,810 --> 01:41:41,070
Don't be afraid.

790
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,610
Nothing is going to happen to you.

791
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:51,610
Put them on picket duty
at the tree line.

792
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:53,880
If the rest of the squad gets back,
have it report immediately to me.

793
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:57,620
Radio for reinforcements, now.

794
01:41:57,790 --> 01:41:59,090
Yes, Captain.

795
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,150
Leave him!

796
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:14,500
Ofelia!

797
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:44,350
Quickly, Your Majesty.

798
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:47,150
Give him to me.

799
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:50,790
The full moon is high in the sky,...

800
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:53,730
...we can open the portal.

801
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:56,260
Why is that in your hand?

802
01:44:57,770 --> 01:45:02,680
The portal will only open
if we offer the blood of an innocent.

803
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:07,420
Just a drop of blood.
A pinprick, that's all.

804
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,110
It's the final task.

805
01:45:10,420 --> 01:45:11,750
Hurry.

806
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:17,550
You promised to obey me!

807
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:20,220
- Give me the boy!
- No!

808
01:45:20,830 --> 01:45:22,960
My brother stays with me.

809
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:29,100
You would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know?

810
01:45:29,170 --> 01:45:31,970
Yes, I would.

811
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,740
You would give up
your throne for him?

812
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:40,470
He who has caused you
such misery, such humiliation?

813
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:43,880
Yes, I would.

814
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:53,690
As you wish, Your Highness.

815
01:46:09,410 --> 01:46:10,440
No!

816
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:10,130
My son.

817
01:47:37,730 --> 01:47:39,390
Tell my son...

818
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:47,330
Tell him what time his father died.

819
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:49,440
- Tell him that I...
- No.

820
01:47:50,650 --> 01:47:52,410
He won't even know your name.

821
01:49:35,250 --> 01:49:37,280
Arise, my daughter.

822
01:49:40,590 --> 01:49:41,850
Come.

823
01:50:08,080 --> 01:50:09,310
Father.

824
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:13,450
You have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent.

825
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:18,060
That was the final task,
and the most important.

826
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:33,840
And you chose well,
Your Highness.

827
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:35,740
Come here with me,...

828
01:50:36,610 --> 01:50:38,740
...and sit by your father's side.

829
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:41,410
He's been waiting for you so long.

830
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:38,100
<i>And it is said the princess
returned to her father's kingdom.</i>

831
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:44,380
<i>That she reigned there with justice
and a kind heart for many centuries.</i>

832
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,540
<i>That she was loved by her people.</i>

833
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:52,520
<i>And that she left behind
small traces of her time on earth,...</i>

834
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:58,350
<i>...visible only to those
who know where to look.</i>

835
01:52:02,850 --> 01:52:06,350
