2
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,331
We need more.

3
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,770
Get any money from your parents
for your birthday?

4
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,936
Give it to me.

5
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,015
- I need it.
- For what?

6
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,496
A train ticket to Copenhagen.

7
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,932
- Why are you going to Copenhagen?
- For a film audition.

8
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,772
You're too ugly to be an actress.
You're so stupid.

9
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,259
- Stop it.
- You look okay now. You look great.

10
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,693
- I'm going to be an actress.
- No one wants to look at you.

11
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,655
- Hand over the money. Hand it over.
- No.

12
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,976
Hand it over!

13
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,735
Relax.

14
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,533
- Do you love me? Do you?
- Yeah.

15
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,856
You're only saying that because
you're afraid I'll steal your money.

16
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,011
Don't you hide money from me.
Don't hide your fucking money!

17
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,529
- Prove you love me.
- How?

18
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:36,532
Beg for it. Go on.
Beg for it.

19
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,416
I'm not on the pill. Lay off!

20
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,977
- Calm down.
- I told you to beg for it!

21
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,933
Okay! Fuck me. Fuck me.

22
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,615
Let go.

23
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,573
Let go.

24
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,379
Thank you!
We can't work in that racket.

25
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,810
I'm sorry.

26
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,694
There, there, Daisy.

27
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,411
Thank you, that was great.

28
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,613
You've got great energy,
many fine moments and a nice face.

29
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,132
But I'm afraid
we can't use you this time.

30
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,051
Next!

31
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,288
This just won't work, Daisy.
We have to help each other.

32
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,492
I don't know what else do to.

33
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,410
You promised to be quiet.
But you never listen.

34
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,973
We're running out of money.
Get it, Daisy?

35
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,618
If you'd let me do these auditions,
I could make some money for us.

36
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:57,292
But oh no, not you. You only care
about yourself and no one else.

37
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,970
You little monster.

38
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,891
Who are you?

39
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,093
I ought to sell you
and make a few bucks.

40
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,096
You cried when you came out of me.
You didn't want to be born.

41
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:28,090
I struggled for 23 hours
to get you out.

42
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,699
You knew you'd only cause me pain.

43
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,337
Think I don't feel like
crying and screaming too?

44
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,929
You're a child.

45
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,373
You haven't earned the right to show
the world all your discontent.

46
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,610
Just because I'm your mother, I don't
have to put up with your tantrums.

47
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:03,819
Think I don't get it?

48
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,775
You hate me because
I forced you into this world.

49
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,292
Is that what you want me to say?

50
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,533
So you get an excuse to think
I'm a terrible mother?

51
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,216
I may well be,
but you know what?

52
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,810
Even if you cry and scream
the rest of your life, -

53
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,652
- I'll still love you more
than anything else.

54
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,533
There, there.

55
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,775
Calm down.

56
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,208
Hush now.

57
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,850
It was at a party, right?

58
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,769
It was late and rowdy.

59
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,450
As the day was dawning,
someone said:

60
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,653
"You have almost everything
as a woman and as an artist."

61
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,170
"But you lack motherliness."

62
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:52,092
You thought it ludicrous and laughed.
But it haunted you later.

63
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,890
You grew concerned and finally
let your husband impregnate you.

64
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,938
You wanted to become a mother.

65
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,019
You became afraid
when there was no turning back.

66
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,499
Afraid of the responsibility.
Afraid of being tied down.

67
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:19,013
Afraid of losing the theater,
afraid of the pain, of dying.

68
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,611
Afraid of your swelling body.

69
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,574
But you keep playing the part.

70
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,693
The part of a happy,
young expectant mother.

71
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,816
Everyone said: "She's so beautiful.
More beautiful than ever before."

72
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:44,731
You tried several times
to procure an abortion, but in vain.

73
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,819
When you realized it was irrevocable,
you hated the child.

74
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,695
You wished for it
to be stillborn.

75
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,690
You wished
your baby would die at birth.

76
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,734
You wanted a stillborn child.

77
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,133
It was a long and complicated birth
that dragged out for several days.

78
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,490
They had to deliver the child
by forceps.

79
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,579
You regarded the disfigured child
with revulsion and whispered:

80
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:34,537
"Please die soon. Please die."

81
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,929
But he survived. The boy cried
day and night, and you hated him.

82
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,339
You were scared.
You were plagued by guilt.

83
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,170
Finally, relatives and a nanny
took care of the baby.

84
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:59,057
And you could rise
and return to the theater.

85
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,571
It won't do
if you don't remember your lines.

86
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,532
I'm sorry but my daughter
was sick all night.

87
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,689
Well, your daughter isn't auditioning
for the part, is she?

88
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,654
But your troubles weren't over.

89
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,138
The little boy developed
an intense love for his mother.

90
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,972
You tried to avoid it because
you felt you couldn't return it.

91
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,736
You kept trying
but it was awkward and cruel...

92
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:58,016
Stop! I want her to be cold as ice
but you're on the verge of tears.

93
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,692
You think he's repulsive
and you're afraid.

94
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,736
Go on.

95
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,177
It just won't work.
You do realize that, don't you?

96
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,496
Let's try the other girl.

97
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,295
- I can do it.
- Thank you! Next.

98
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,935
- Please consider me for the part.
- We'll let you know.

99
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,974
- I want to know now.
- Didn't you hear me? Thank you!

100
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,298
We'll send you a letter. Next!

101
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,177
You might as well leave.
I got the part.

102
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,818
Didn't you hear me? Go away.
She's found the one she wants.

103
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,016
Come along.

104
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:06,980
<i>Karl-Henrik and I rented
a cottage by the sea.</i>

105
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,609
<i>Karl-Henrik and I rented
a cottage by the sea.</i>

106
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,132
<i>It was in June and we had
the place all to ourselves.</i>

107
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,050
<i>One day he went to town
and I went to the beach on my own.</i>

108
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,253
<i>It was a hot, sunny day.</i>

109
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,419
<i>Another girl was there.
She lived on a nearby island -</i>

110
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,058
<i>- but had paddled over to our beach
because it was more undisturbed.</i>

111
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,572
<i>We lay there side by side
completely naked in the sun.</i>

112
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,614
<i>We dozed off and woke up
and just lay there.</i>

113
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,576
<i>We wore these cheap
straw hats.</i>

114
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,090
<i>Mine had a blue band.</i>

115
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,417
<i>I lay there peering out
from under the hat.</i>

116
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:01,138
<i>- Taking in the scenery...
- Shut up!</i>

117
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:09,217
Why aren't you crying now? You only
do it to ruin everything for me.

118
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,379
You ruin it
for everyone else, too.

119
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,255
They wanted to watch the film
but you ruined it.

120
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,250
They thought: "What
an impossible brat." But you're not.

121
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:27,614
You're not impossible.
But all you can do is cry.

122
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,654
You can't even tell me
what you're upset about.

123
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,853
What are you so upset about?

124
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,656
Is it me?

125
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,453
Am I the one who upsets you so?

126
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,459
Look.

127
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,135
That's you. See?

128
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,292
That's you and me.
Little Daisy.

129
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,855
Give Mommy a smile.

130
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,777
Look, Daisy. You and me.

131
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,176
My beautiful little Daisy.

132
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,379
Remember when we went
to the woods? Yes, you do.

133
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:55,053
We laid down in the grass by the lake
and you reached for a flower.

134
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,096
It was a daisy.

135
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,739
Yes, you reached out like that.
And I took your little hand in mine.

136
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,731
You grabbed my finger
and held it tight.

137
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:19,017
And you smiled. That was
the first time I saw you smile.

138
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,938
Remember?

139
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,177
Yes, you do.

140
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,612
You were awfully beautiful.

141
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,137
Look at my belly.
All saggy.

142
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,731
And my breasts are droopy
like two empty bags.

143
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,012
And it's all your fault.

144
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,930
Happy now?
No one else wants Mommy.

145
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,655
You've got me all to yourself.

146
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,179
I'm sorry.
That was a dumb thing to say.

147
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,408
Please don't cry.

148
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,488
Please, Daisy.
Don't cry anymore.

149
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,773
I can't stand any more of it.

150
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,215
If you really love me,
you'll stop crying right now.

151
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,049
Now!

152
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:52,937
Good God!
I can't do anything with you.

153
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,894
All you can do is scream.

154
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,491
That's enough. Be quiet.

155
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,090
Stop screaming
and everything will be all right.

156
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,810
Where have you been?
Your letters didn't reveal much.

157
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:14,617
- Your sister's right. You're a mess.
- Look at yourself. You're a loser.

158
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,655
So you come running back to Daddy.
Daddy's little pet, huh?

159
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:26,015
Do you want to know a secret?
I'm really quite proud of you.

160
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,895
You and I don't put on a show.

161
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,491
We're true to ourselves
and always have been,

162
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,498
I remember you in your crib,
new-born.

163
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,659
I put my finger
into your little hand -

164
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,650
- and you grabbed it
and held it tight.

165
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,978
And I said to myself:
"That's my girl!"

166
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,300
- Daddy...
- She's got willpower.

167
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,618
The others' hands were like Jell-o.
But not yours.

168
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,655
- I didn't become an actress.
- No, I guessed you'd failed.

169
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,091
Or else you wouldn't have returned
without the Palms, would you?

170
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,576
I became a hooker.

171
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:20,855
- I've been fucked by strange men.
- A piece of chocolate, anyone?

172
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:25,099
Excuse me, but someone's baby
is crying its head off out here.

173
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,738
- Oh, come on! We're doing a scene.
- Whose child is it out here?

174
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:36,810
Someone has got to own that kid.
Right?

175
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,298
- It's mine.
- I see. You've got kids?

176
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,016
- It's my sister's. I'm babysitting.
- And what a fine job you're doing.

177
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,017
I'm sorry.

178
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,657
Let's get on with it. Next!

179
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:05,571
- Thanks. Maybe we'll call you.
- She's not mine, so it's no problem.

180
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,692
Welcome. Take a seat.

181
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,734
That's your mother,
your sister and your father.

182
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,971
Let's start from the top.

183
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,689
You have to go to sleep now.

184
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,088
I have to, anyway.

185
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,579
You can stay awake
but I need to get some sleep.

186
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:59,531
You don't decide when I get to sleep.
You don't decide everything.

187
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,816
Right?

188
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,898
I'm going to sleep. Good night.

189
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:03,698
God, you're mean.
Can't I sleep for just five minutes?

190
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,656
Be quiet.

191
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,858
Shut up and go to sleep!

192
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,330
Shut up, will you?

193
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:07,895
I'm sorry for yelling at you
and being so unreasonable.

194
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,660
Forgive me.

195
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,735
I only want what's best for you.
It's not your fault I'm your mother.

196
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,774
You shouldn't have to listen
to all my crap.

197
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:36,294
Why I want the part? I believe
I can add something unique to it.

198
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,335
I'm going to draw on
my own experiences.

199
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:51,216
Promise me to be quiet.
Please.

200
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,732
You really have to
help me now, Daisy. Don't cry.

201
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,168
Okay?

202
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,292
Okay. Let's get a move on.

203
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,732
I can do it.

204
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,331
I can do it.

205
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:35,290
- Hi. Anna Nordberg?
- Yes.

206
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:42,611
- What are you going to do for us?
- I'm playing Laura, the blond.

207
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,216
I believe I can add
something unique to the part -

208
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,335
- by drawing on my own experiences.
"Insight" sounds so pretentious...

209
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:58,376
- Right, fine. Got any training?
- I attended a drama school in Malmø.

210
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,051
- Which one?
- The Malmø Private Drama School.

211
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,175
- Never heard of it.
- But it didn't meet my standards.

212
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,735
Walk up and down, please.

213
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:18,051
Imagine you're the sexiest woman
alive out to score Brad Pitt.

214
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:27,016
Could you loosen up
your hips a little?

215
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,412
Try to use your entire body,
including the upper part, -

216
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,135
- to get a better flow.

217
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,012
Okay, look, Anna.

218
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:54,816
I don't see you as a sexy bimbo.
Sorry.

219
00:28:55,060 --> 00:29:01,249
- I can too play sexy.
- And your breasts are too small.

220
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:06,773
- I'll buy a push-up bra.
- There are nude scenes, too.

221
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,734
They look much larger on screen.
Give me a chance.

222
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,775
- I already have.
- I'm sexier than everyone else!

223
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,016
I'm sure you are.

224
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:22,691
You don't know shit. You're a lousy
director. Everyone puts you down.

225
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,769
Directors, actors and critics.
All your films are crap!

226
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,019
Okay, fine.
Thanks for coming.

227
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,060
- No.
- Yes, go away.

228
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:42,051
No, you have to give me
another chance. Give me a chance!

229
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,809
You have to give me chance
to show what I can do.

230
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,935
Give me something I can work with.
Looking sexy isn't acting!

231
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:56,089
Only soap opera directors want that.
Give me a chance.

232
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:00,578
I can play any role better than
anyone else! I can be anything!

233
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:05,934
Actually, that was quite good,
only we're not looking for a psycho.

234
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,214
Bye for now.

235
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,138
You have to eat.

236
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,219
I need peace to work
so I can get a job and earn money.

237
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,379
You don't want to live
on the streets, do you?

238
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:56,018
Please, Daisy.
For my sake, try again.

239
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,371
It's really yummy. Look.

240
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,890
Come on.

241
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,494
Please, Daisy,
don't be so pigheaded.

242
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:23,055
I haven't got any more milk. How long
are you going to punish me for that?

243
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:29,017
You're going to die if you don't eat.
Eat something, now!

244
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,889
I'm sick of discussing this.
I'm in charge here!

245
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:45,572
You're going to eat now.
You're going to eat now, God damn it!

246
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,215
Open wide.

247
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:57,174
Eat!

248
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,292
Daisy!

249
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,488
Please sleep. All night.

250
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,658
You have to. Good night.

251
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,090
Now what's wrong?

252
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:52,093
Great, Daisy!
Trust you to do it now!

253
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:57,374
You know all the stores are shut.
Smart move, Daisy!

254
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,450
You always make things so difficult.
We haven't got any diapers.

255
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:13,055
No diaper here, no diaper there.
Trust you to do this!

256
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,857
Pee, pee, pee!
Are you happy now, Daisy?

257
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,888
Shut up! Shut up!

258
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,493
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

259
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,649
Shut up! I can't take it anymore.
Shut up!

260
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,251
I can't take it anymore.

261
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,369
I can't take it anymore.

262
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,574
Shut up!

263
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,899
Forgive me.

264
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:17,811
You deserve to go to hell.
How can anyone forgive you for this?

265
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:23,538
I want her back.
I want her to come back.

266
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,731
It's too late.

267
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,728
She'll never cry again.
Happy now?

268
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,219
I didn't mean to kill her.
I just couldn't...

269
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,059
I didn't mean to...

270
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:43,015
Spare me your excuses.
Your action speaks for itself.

271
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,451
You ought to be hanged... and shot.

272
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:53,498
I'm not an evil person.
She kept crying and I could take it.

273
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,329
I didn't want to...
I didn't mean to...

274
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:02,056
You're an evil, repulsive person.
May you burn in hell.

275
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,889
I want to make it right.

276
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:13,252
I want her back.
I want to tell her I'm sorry.

277
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,692
- I love her.
- It's too late.

278
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,449
I love her...

279
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,333
Thank you.

280
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,419
It says you speak fluent Danish
but it doesn't sound like it.

281
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:45,095
But I do. "The rain
in the Danish plain falls mainly..."

282
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,816
- Very good, but...
- I'll go to language school.

283
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,976
There's no time.

284
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:57,379
Why can't I have an accent? There
are lots of foreigners in Denmark.

285
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,777
We need someone to play a guest
in the church. She's got a few lines.

286
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,019
The lead actress Sofie Gråbøl
meets her at the funeral.

287
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,054
- I'll take it.
- How old are you?

288
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,811
- 22, but...
- Almost too old.

289
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,616
- What did you have in mind?
- In mind?

290
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,014
I don't know.

291
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:28,977
You're not a trained actress
so I can't give you the rate.

292
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:34,054
But if you do it for free,
it's yours.

293
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,616
Thanks.

294
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:42,291
How can anyone forgive you for this?
She's dead.

295
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,933
I can't go on living. I love her.
I didn't mean to...

296
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,656
You're an evil, repulsive person.
You ought to be hanged and shot.

297
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,819
I didn't mean to kill her.
I just couldn't...

298
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,817
Cut!

299
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:05,891
Sofie, I want you to cry for real
or I won't believe you're sad.

300
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:09,137
Okay? We need sympathize with you.

301
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,900
So more tears, please.

302
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,535
From the top.

303
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,779
Roll camera.

304
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,216
Action!

305
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:34,498
She's dead. How can anyone
forgive you for this?

306
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:40,297
I didn't mean to kill her.
I just couldn't...

307
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,731
I didn't mean to...

308
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,010
Forgive me.

309
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,930
Forgive me.

310
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:56,294
You're an evil, repulsive person.
May you burn in hell.

311
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,733
I'm not an evil person. She
kept crying and I couldn't take it.

312
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,092
Spare me your excuses.
Your action speaks for itself.

313
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,019
You ought to be hanged and shot.

314
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:14,692
I want to make it right.
I want her back.

315
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,769
I want to tell her I'm sorry.
I love her.

316
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,893
- I love her. I love her.
- Cut!

317
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:31,176
- It's a wrap. Next scene.
- Well, that's that, then.

318
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,134
- That's all for today.
- But I had a scene with lines.

319
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:41,131
They cut it. But thanks anyway.
Maybe we'll see you again.

320
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,013
<i>When I was a girl, my Mom sold me
to men who abused me -</i>

321
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,929
<i>- so she could get money for booze.</i>

322
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:08,295
<i>When she came home drunk, she cut
me with a razor blade while I slept.</i>

323
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,893
<i>She was angry with me for being born
so she couldn't get a new man.</i>

324
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,219
<i>Know what she said to me?</i>

325
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:26,376
"Incredible that a person can live
with all the hate I feel for you."

326
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:35,460
That's the kind of lines he wrote.
I told him they rung false.

327
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,051
I told him to revise the dialogue
or I didn't want to be in his film.

328
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:49,938
- More wine? Or something else?
- Wine is fine.

329
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:54,053
- Your scene turned out great.
- It did?

330
00:43:54,260 --> 00:44:00,369
- It worked well with you and Sofie.
- You have a great way with actors.

331
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,172
You think so?

332
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,578
It's a relief to meet
a competent director -

333
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,898
- who doesn't have to assert himself
all the time.

334
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,170
Cheers.

335
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,692
You've chosen a tough racket
but I think you're going to make it.

336
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,779
- You do?
- I wouldn't say it otherwise.

337
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:26,531
You've got presence
and an interesting face.

338
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:32,417
You've got self-discipline. You have
to be passionate about your work.

339
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:36,818
If it's just a fad,
you might as well forget it.

340
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,290
I've always wanted
to be an actress.

341
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:47,211
Like when you were a kid
and dressed up. A way of escape.

342
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:23,208
<i>Want to make me happy?</i>

343
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,379
<i>I know It's a lot to ask
but I need your help.</i>

344
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:31,858
<i>It's no big deal.
I just want you to talk to me.</i>

345
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,450
<i>Not about anything in particular.
Anything you like.</i>

346
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:40,814
<i>What we're having for dinner, or
if the sea's cold after the storm.</i>

347
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,979
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

348
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:51,415
How would you like to go back
to my place and have sex?

349
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,137
Think of it as a casting.

350
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,289
It'll make it easier for me
to recommend you to other directors.

351
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:16,252
<i>I always thought great artists
sympathized with others.</i>

352
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:23,010
<i>I thought their art sprung
from a need to help others.</i>

353
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,780
<i>How stupid of me.</i>

354
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,419
<i>Talk to me, Daisy.</i>

355
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,018
<i>Please.</i>

356
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:43,897
I haven't abandoned you. I just hid
you so they can't do anything to you.

357
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:55,613
Someday you'll come for me
and I'll be as pure as you.

358
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:06,375
Think I can't be?

359
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:16,772
Think I can't be as pure as you?

360
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,771
<i>- Mommy.
- Yes.</i>

361
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,939
<i>I was something special.</i>

362
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,258
<i>Did you ever think about that?</i>

363
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:36,211
<i>There's never been anyone like me
and there never will be.</i>

364
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,415
Don't you love me anymore?

365
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,859
- But you have to.
- Because you're my mother?

366
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:51,451
- Yes, of course.
- What if I don't?

367
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,615
- Then you're not a good daughter.
- You're not a good mother.

368
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,380
I never said I was.

369
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:06,370
A mother should make a child
who loves her, or she's a bad mother.

370
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:12,495
What if you don't deserve my love?

371
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:18,252
- If you aren't nice enough?
- Then you shouldn't have made me.

372
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:22,294
I didn't mean to.

373
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:27,255
Why didn't you just get an abortion
and kill me right from the start?

374
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,336
<i>I didn't have the guts.</i>

375
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,577
I'm sorry.

376
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:04,576
Rapunzel was afraid of the prince.
She'd never seen a man before.

377
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:10,696
But he was so nice and polite
that she soon forgot her fear.

378
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,769
Now that the prince saw Rapunzel, -

379
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:18,939
- she looked even lovelier
than he had thought.

380
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:25,370
"He's wonderful," thought Rapunzel.
"I think I'm in love."

381
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:30,495
That accentjust won't do.
Thomas said you spoke fluent Danish.

382
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:36,138
Rapunzel is Danish and doesn't talk
Swedish. We'll have to replace you.

383
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:47,219
How about dinner sometime?
You're incredibly beautiful.

384
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,978
Let me give you my phone number.

385
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:15,852
I love being a director.
Know what I love even more?

386
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,848
That special chemistry between
two people who've only just met -

387
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:24,019
- and who don't have a flying fuck
in common.

388
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,450
Are you married?

389
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:30,778
Is that something you need to know
before the rest of the night unfolds?

390
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:35,178
Think you have to take off your
panties in order to play Rapunzel?

391
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,699
No...

392
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:42,770
If I choose to fuck you tonight,
it doesn't affect my marriage.

393
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:47,735
You're gone tomorrow. If you're
a good lay and I remember you, -

394
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:53,094
- you get to play Rapunzel next time.
Does that answer your question?

395
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:02,769
I sense you're a real actress.

396
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:09,328
Free of any real pain.
Nothing really hurts you.

397
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:15,979
If it hurts, you use it in a scene.
I envy you that.

398
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:22,619
Your superficiality. Everything rolls
off on you, know what I mean?

399
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:30,535
Know what?
I love actresses.

400
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:35,256
Particularly when they get too old.
Like you'll be someday.

401
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,532
That... pain.

402
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:45,689
Not because it's a meaningless,
war-ridden, violent, evil world, -

403
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:50,610
- no, you're in pain because
no one wants to look at you anymore.

404
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:53,539
You have too many wrinkles.

405
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,937
Your charm's lost its charm.

406
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,257
Your ass is saggy,
your boobs are droopy.

407
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,851
That's when it comes creeping in...
the pain.

408
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:11,454
But it's a gift for you, because
it'll make a real actress out of you.

409
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,891
Just a shame it's too late.

410
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:20,458
That pain is the only thing
that will ever be real to you.

411
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:23,220
To hell with the world.

412
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,049
<i>The tragedy of the world is
that no one sees you.</i>

413
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:31,936
Suddenly there's nothing left of you
and what you thought was your life.

414
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:37,817
Nothing but the empty shell
craving attention.

415
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:46,969
That desperate folly,
for some reason I respect that.

416
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:52,454
You don't feel hurt, do you?

417
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:00,374
- Why do you think I'm here?
- What do you mean?

418
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,891
If I didn't think
I could fuck my way to a part, -

419
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:09,015
- I wouldn't waste an entire evening
on a jerk like you, would I?

420
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:14,534
Don't be miffed.

421
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,213
Give me a smile.

422
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,899
I don't want to.

423
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,297
That's more like it.

424
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:49,460
I just wrote a script
with a female lead.

425
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:54,097
It's Joan of Arc
as an animated film.

426
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,134
About a woman who really
believes in something.

427
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:03,175
Who's got conviction,
principles, ideals.

428
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,690
All the stuff you actors
don't know crap about.

429
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:14,056
Would you like to go
back to my place and read it?

430
00:56:56,540 --> 00:57:01,455
Hi. I've seen you in the back yard.

431
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:07,337
Itjust struck me
you always carry your kid around.

432
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,532
Can't you afford a baby buggy?

433
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,699
I don't use mine anymore,
so I thought you could use it.

434
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:20,258
- No thanks.
- I'll sell it to you cheap. 500.

435
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:24,499
- No thanks.
- It's bad for your back.

436
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:29,490
Let me just go and get it
so you can see it, okay?

437
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:18,892
- How can I help you?
- I'd like a part in your films.

438
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:28,216
You think I can't?
Think I'm not talented enough?

439
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:35,178
We've got fixed rates.
Girl-girl, 1,500. Girl-boy, 2,000.

440
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:37,848
Gangbang, 2,500.

441
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:45,852
Alex and I borrowed
his friends' house by the sea.

442
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:51,578
One day he went to town to get
some speed, and I went to the beach.

443
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,250
It was a nice, hot day.

444
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,769
There was another girl
at the beach.

445
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:03,179
We lay there side by side
completely naked in the sun.

446
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:08,090
Suddenly I noticed two people
on the rocks opposite to us.

447
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:13,693
"Two guys are watching us,"
I told the girl.

448
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,336
"Let them," she said.

449
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:21,169
I could see they were quite young.

450
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:30,168
The bravest one went over
and crouched down next to Katarina.

451
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:37,220
He pretended to have a problem with
his foot and fiddled with his toes.

452
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:43,459
I felt a strange sensation.

453
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:49,132
Suddenly I heard Katarina say:
"Aren't you turned on?"

454
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,932
She took his hand
and helped him undress.

455
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,335
Suddenly he was on top of her.

456
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:03,809
She helped him inside
and held his bum.

457
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:08,696
The other guy sat on the rocks
watching.

458
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:14,133
I heard Katarina whisper something
in his ear and laugh.

459
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:21,212
His face was right in front of me
all red and puffy.

460
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:30,370
I turned to him:
"Don't you want to be with me too?"

461
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:38,052
Katarina said:
"Be with her now."

462
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:44,130
So he pulled out of her
and threw himself at me.

463
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:49,573
Han grabbed my breast
and squeezed it until it hurt.

464
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:55,696
But somehow I was ready
and came almost right away.

465
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:01,497
I was just about to say: "Don't
get me pregnant." Then he came.

466
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:06,413
I felt
like I'd never felt it before -

467
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:11,057
- how his sperm gushed into me.

468
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:17,051
He bent over backwards
and came over and over again.

469
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:22,414
Katarina lay watching him
and held him from behind.

470
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:28,215
When he was finished, she took
his hand and made herself come.

471
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:33,858
When she came, she let out a loud
scream, and we all started laughing.

472
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:46,935
Sorry, I'm babbling. Do you mind?
You're great to talk to.

473
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:52,659
It so warm and nice.

474
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:58,819
You're the first person
who's ever listened to me.

475
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:04,772
We went for a swim and parted.

476
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:10,852
When I came home from the beach,
Alex was waiting.

477
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:17,255
He wanted money
but I wouldn't give him any.

478
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:22,136
He was furious and raped me
until I gave it to him.

479
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:27,972
He fucked you against your will
with his big, fat cock.

480
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,655
You're making me horny.
Did you know that?

481
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,135
I'll show you.

482
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,490
Thanks. Now for the close-ups.

483
01:02:57,340 --> 01:03:01,811
Can I ask you something?
Michael wants to know if you do anal.

484
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:08,493
You get 200 extra.
What do I tell him?

485
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:14,248
- We could get another girl.
- No, it's okay.

486
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,894
Anal is okay.

487
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:31,254
- Yes, yes, yes!
- More, Anna.

488
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:38,135
Pull it out and
dick whip her ass.

489
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:43,539
And back in.
Scream again, Anna.

490
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,534
More, Anna. Scream.

491
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,857
- I'm coming.
- Stop him! We need close-ups.

492
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:57,449
Stop him!

493
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,730
What the hell are you doing?

494
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:34,494
<i>One day I'll come to you, Daisy,
and we'll be together forever.</i>

495
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:42,695
<i>I'll take you in my arms. You'll
rest your head on my shoulder.</i>

496
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:51,690
<i>I'll hug you and apologize
for all the things I've done to you.</i>

497
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,219
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

498
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:01,453
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

499
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:34,577
<i>I'll take your cold hands in mine
and warm them.</i>

500
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:39,331
Feel your breath on my cheek.

501
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:43,977
You'll feel my heart beat.

502
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:49,857
We'll hug each other,
our hearts beating in time.

503
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:55,297
And you'll be me, -

504
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:59,254
- and I'll be you.

505
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,889
Nice ass.

506
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:10,056
Perfect tits. That's good.

507
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:14,492
Most men don't like hookers with
big tits. Reminds them of their mom.

508
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:17,089
You look more like their daughter.

509
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,690
Especially if you shave your pussy.

510
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,176
Okay, sit down.

511
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:32,535
You look fantastic.
You really have star quality.

512
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:38,178
- You think so?
- I'm an old whore. I never lie.

513
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,730
Glamour Girls, hello.

514
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:47,819
She's no longer with us. But we have
a new girl starting tomorrow.

515
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:52,899
Do you do anal?

516
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:56,017
Golden shower?

517
01:07:59,100 --> 01:08:01,170
Urine sex.

518
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:06,533
No.
That's quite all right. Bye.

519
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:13,129
- So, what should we call you?
- Call me?

520
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:16,650
Your stage name. Lulu...

521
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:21,257
Sabrina? Vanessa?

522
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,612
Daisy...

523
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,814
...Diamond.

524
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:30,454
I want to be called Daisy Diamond.

525
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:51,212
<i>Daisy Diamond. "Born to please".</i>

526
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:55,930
<i>Absolute novice.</i>

527
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,136
<i>New to the business.</i>

528
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,732
<i>Raunchy, -</i>

529
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:10,492
<i>- seductive and super sexy.</i>

530
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:18,250
<i>A naughty little schoolgirl
eager to play forbidden games.</i>

531
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:25,248
<i>Daisy Diamond.</i>

532
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:30,773
<i>Daisy's got a cute babydoll face
with silky lips made for sucking.</i>

533
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:37,613
<i>Large, innocent Bambi eyes that read
your fantasies like an open book.</i>

534
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:41,972
<i>An insatiable sex kitten with
a slender, elastic X-rated body -</i>

535
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:45,695
<i>- offering you
first-class Lollta sex.</i>

536
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:50,257
<i>Her lustful girly breasts
long for your touch.</i>

537
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:53,975
<i>Her ever-happy nipples
are always ready to play.</i>

538
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:57,252
<i>Her mischievous ass is firm, -</i>

539
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:04,093
<i>- and her wet virgin tight
honey pot is longing for you.</i>

540
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:09,614
Hi, I'm Daisy.

541
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:18,209
Lie down
and I'll show you a good time.

542
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:32,217
Is that nice?

543
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:36,494
Can I ask you something?

544
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:43,451
Will you pretend to be my mom?

545
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,137
How do you want your mom to be?

546
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:59,893
Very strict.
And I've been a bad boy.

547
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,933
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

548
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:10,732
- Have you been a bad boy today?
- No... I kissed one of the girls.

549
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:15,730
Bad boy! You know Mommy doesn't
like you kissing other girls.

550
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:23,057
- No dinner for you, then.
- I'm sorry, Mommy.

551
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:25,137
I'm sorry.

552
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:31,098
Bad boy!
Mommy is very disappointed in you.

553
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,895
- Bad boy.
- I'm sorry.

554
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:43,649
Mommy's little boy.
Let Mommy comfort you.

555
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:05,537
<i>You tried several times
to procure an abortion, but in vain.</i>

556
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:11,214
<i>When you realized
it was irrevocable, -</i>

557
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:18,690
<i>- you hated the child
and wished for it to be stillborn.</i>

558
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:25,090
<i>You wanted a stillborn child.</i>

559
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:32,131
<i>You wanted the child to die.</i>

560
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:37,892
<i>It was a long and complicated birth
that dragged out for several days.</i>

561
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:42,137
<i>They had to deliver the child
by forceps.</i>

562
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:46,379
<i>You regarded the disfigured child
with revulsion and whispered:</i>

563
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:50,892
<i>"Please die soon.
Please die. "</i>

564
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:56,254
<i>The boy cried day and night,
and you hated him.</i>

565
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:01,454
<i>You were scared.
You were plagued by guilt.</i>

566
01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:07,889
<i>But your troubles weren't over.</i>

567
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,535
Hello.

568
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:28,932
I sorted out the children's clothes
and thought you might like this.

569
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:35,693
And I brought the buggy. If you can't
afford it, we'll work something out.

570
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:39,495
- Do you have a boy or a girl?
- A boy.

571
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:43,852
- What's his name?
- No, I've got a girl.

572
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:46,494
Don't you know what you've got?

573
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:52,969
Yes. My friend's looking after her.
She's got a child, too.

574
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:57,412
Come with me.
It won't take long.

575
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:12,217
I run a day care. Let me look after
your child and you have her nearby.

576
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,170
Let's give you a bath.

577
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:25,579
Hold him while I run the bath,
will you?

578
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,849
Okay, bring him in.

579
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,334
Come on in.

580
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:29,650
- What can I do for you today?
- Something a little more advanced.

581
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,612
You're a fast mover.

582
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,890
Fuck me.

583
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:24,170
<i>Mommy.
Have you got a mommy, too?</i>

584
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:29,215
<i>- Everyone's got a mommy.
- Did she take good care of you?</i>

585
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,890
Don't ask so many questions.

586
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:44,769
<i>- Mommy.
- Yes, Daisy.</i>

587
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:48,211
<i>- Where's Daddy?
- Why?</i>

588
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:52,936
<i>He took off
because he couldn't stand you.</i>

589
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:56,815
It wasn't my fault,
it was yours.

590
01:16:57,020 --> 01:17:00,251
The thought of having you
terrified him.

591
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:05,853
Daddy took off because he hated you.
So he didn't want to save you.

592
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:09,848
Am I right?

593
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:14,819
Don't you think
I deserve to be saved?

594
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:22,210
- No, not the way you are.
- Now you're upsetting me.

595
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:28,052
A person can't behave like you
and expect to be saved.

596
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:33,250
No, maybe you're right.

597
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:07,256
Know what?
I should have kept my dick.

598
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:12,174
I miss my dick.

599
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:18,536
Think you can get it back?

600
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:23,609
Don't you think
you can buy one in China?

601
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:27,976
No, I bet they've gotten too rich.

602
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:33,059
I bet they've stopped selling
organs and peckers in China.

603
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:36,570
You need to go to Africa.

604
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:41,974
Mind you, that would look funny.
Picture this.

605
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:48,494
My pale ass, and when I turn around,
I've got a black boner.

606
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:52,251
No, that won't work.

607
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:00,619
Daisy?

608
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:05,495
Is there anything wrong?

609
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:18,733
What's up?

610
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,973
You can tell me.

611
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:39,290
I'm your friend, Daisy.

612
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,370
You can trust me.

613
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:47,612
Okay?

614
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,450
What's wrong?

615
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:13,009
I was raped by my boyfriend.

616
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:19,170
My parents turned their backs on me
so I ran off to Copenhagen.

617
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:26,453
He got me pregnant.

618
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:31,893
I gave birth at Hvidovre Hospital.

619
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:36,573
But I couldn't take care of her.
I didn't have any milk.

620
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:42,138
She refused to eat anything else.
She never slept and I never slept.

621
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:52,291
Everything fell apart, and finally
I drowned her in the bathtub.

622
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:58,814
I ran in and took her little body.
She was four months old.

623
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:03,013
Then I held her down
in the water until...

624
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:09,734
...until she didn't move anymore.

625
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:15,014
She was all blue and heavy
when I pulled her out of the water.

626
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:22,257
And now, here I am.

627
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:30,691
What a terrible story, Daisy.

628
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:37,896
But I'm glad you...

629
01:21:41,740 --> 01:21:46,894
I take it as a great vote
of confidence that you told me.

630
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:50,251
I really appreciate it.

631
01:21:57,220 --> 01:22:00,815
You're not Daisy Diamond anymore.

632
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:04,970
Now you're a real human being to me.

633
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:17,457
Now I've heard your story.

634
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:20,775
Now I know something about you.

635
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:28,413
- I've got something on you, Daisy.
- What?

636
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:33,411
Did you think about that?

637
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:57,978
- Hi.
- What do you want?

638
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:01,968
Why don't you answer your phone?
I want to help you.

639
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:06,537
- I talked to some directors...
- I don't want your help.

640
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:11,575
I don't believe you. You're lying.
You're lonely and I want to help you.

641
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:14,817
- Shut up and get lost!
- You're miserable.

642
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:19,457
- I don't want you here! Shut up!
- I want to help you.

643
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:59,448
<i>Look at me.</i>

644
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:04,490
<i>Everything is ending now.</i>

645
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:09,928
<i>Everything is disappearing.
Ending.</i>

646
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:16,016
<i>I'm coming to you, Daisy.</i>

647
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:19,610
<i>I'm coming home to you now.</i>

648
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,855
<i>Now.</i>

649
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:43,335
Hey, get out of here!

650
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:47,818
Do you hear me? Get lost!
Don't you take my customers.

651
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:50,215
Fuck off!

652
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:56,215
I want half an hour.

653
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:00,531
No condom, okay?

654
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:24,579
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

655
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:29,370
How much do you charge for nothing?

656
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,538
I don't get it...

657
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:40,738
I'm giving you 4,000 kroner.
You get that, don't you?

658
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:48,449
I don't want any money.

659
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:31,298
My mom and dad
won't kiss me anymore.

660
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:35,857
They're afraid of catching it.

661
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:51,612
Know what the biggest
life killer is?

662
01:26:51,820 --> 01:26:57,053
That we protect ourselves.
We're protecting ourselves to death.

663
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:04,216
But not you and me, huh?
Not the two of us.

664
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:33,689
<i>Do you miss me, Daisy?
Do you?</i>

665
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:39,299
<i>I miss you too.</i>

666
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:43,334
<i>Please let me
come home to you now.</i>

667
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:47,374
<i>Can I? I miss you.</i>

668
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:55,452
<i>I miss your breath and your lips
when I kiss you good morning.</i>

669
01:27:55,660 --> 01:28:01,018
<i>I miss taking a bath with you
and you comforting me when I cry.</i>

670
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:07,170
<i>I miss you sneezing on my shirt and
biting my finger when you're hungry.</i>

671
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:11,532
<i>I miss you kicking my belly
when you're mad at me.</i>

672
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:15,813
<i>I miss your screams so I can comfort
you and you sleeping with me -</i>

673
01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:18,409
<i>- protecting me against nightmares.</i>

674
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:22,659
<i>I miss your soft skin
against my face -</i>

675
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:27,058
<i>- and feeling your little round head
nestling in my hand.</i>

676
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:32,732
<i>I miss feeding you
and keeping you alive.</i>

677
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:37,616
<i>I miss your chubby little feet.</i>

678
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:41,495
<i>I miss your warm body.</i>

679
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:44,897
<i>I miss getting you dressed
in the morning -</i>

680
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:50,413
<i>- and you resisting
because you'd rather be naked.</i>

681
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,815
<i>I miss carrying you -</i>

682
01:28:56,020 --> 01:29:01,140
<i>- and holding
your life in my hands.</i>

683
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:10,929
<i>I'm coming home to you now.</i>

684
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:15,577
<i>All the dirt has been washed off.</i>

685
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:21,332
<i>I'm going to be pure again.
I promise you.</i>

686
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:28,331
<i>I'm coming home to you.
Then everything will begin.</i>

687
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:34,249
<i>I'm coming. Now.</i>

688
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:42,009
Hi, Sofie.
Describe your character to us.

689
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:43,972
Hi, Thomas.

690
01:29:47,940 --> 01:29:51,535
I hope you enjoy the film.

691
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:59,335
- Hi, Thomas. I have to talk to you.
- I don't have time for that.

692
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:02,976
- It's important.
- Sorry.

693
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:15,338
- What's in it for me?
- The rights to my story.

694
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:22,013
- What about you?
- I want the lead part.

695
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:31,657
- So this is where you're hiding.
- Hi, Sofie.

696
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:36,331
Have you met Anna?
Anna, this is Sofie.

697
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:39,612
- You have met before.
- Where?

698
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:44,735
- Anna was in the church scene.
- Right. Now I remember.

699
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:48,057
I thought I... Hi.

700
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:54,176
- Can we take your picture?
- Sure you can.

701
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:58,056
Call me.

702
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:08,860
Okay, the last one.

703
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:16,729
- You never grow tired of this girl.
- Oh, you don't?

704
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:28,452
Anna, whenever you're ready.

705
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:58,811
Anna? Okay?

706
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:05,250
Roll camera.

707
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:08,338
Quiet on the set.

708
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:11,773
And... action.
