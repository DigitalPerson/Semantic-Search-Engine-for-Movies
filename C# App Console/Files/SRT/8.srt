00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,209
(beeping)

2
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:45,744
(coin dropping)

3
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,482
<i>My name's ralph,</i>
<i>and I'm a bad guy.</i>

4
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:58,323
<i>Let's see. I'm nine feet tal.</i>
<i>I weigh 643 pounds.</i>

5
00:00:58,325 --> 00:00:59,591
<i>Got a little bit</i>
<i>of a temper on me.</i>

6
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,226
<i>Hey, you moved my stump!</i>

7
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,529
(growling)

8
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,497
Ralph:  <i>My passion bubbles</i>
<i>very near the surface,</i>

9
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,099
<i>I guess, not gonna lie.</i>

10
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,669
<i>Anyhoo, what else? Uh..</i>

11
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,407
<i>I'm a wrecker. I wreck thing.</i>
<i>Professionally.</i>

12
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,342
<i>I'm going to wreck it!</i>

13
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,645
<i>I'm very good at what I do.</i>
<i>Probably the best I know.</i>

14
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,346
(yelling)

15
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,183
<i>The thing is, fixing</i>
<i>is the name of the game.</i>

16
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,118
<i>Literally,</i>
<i>fix-it felix, jr.</i>

17
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,853
Nicelanders:
<i>Fix it, felix!</i>

18
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,388
<i>I can fix it!</i>

19
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,223
Ralph:  <i>So, yeah, naturally,</i>

20
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:33,625
<i>The guy with the name</i>
<i>fix-it felix is the good g.</i>

21
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,861
<i>He's nice enough</i>
<i>as good guys go.</i>

22
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:38,097
<i>Definitely fixes</i>
<i>stuff really well.</i>

23
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,699
<i>But, uh, if you've</i>
<i>got a magic hammer</i>

24
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,434
<i>From your father,</i>

25
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,336
<i>How hard can it be?</i>

26
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,406
<i>If he was a regular contractr</i>
<i>carpenter guy,</i>

27
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,641
<i>I guarantee you</i>
<i>would not be able</i>

28
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:51,110
<i>To fix the damage</i>
<i>that I do as quickly.</i>

29
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,682
<i>And when felix does</i>
<i>a good job, he gets a me.</i>

30
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:59,585
<i>But are there medals for</i>
<i>wrecking stuff really well?</i>

31
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,720
<i>To that I say, "ha!"</i>

32
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,522
(growls loudly)

33
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,757
<i>And, no, there aren't.</i>

34
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,792
(indistinct conversations)

35
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,230
<i>Thirty years I've</i>
<i>been doing this</i>

36
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,899
<i>And I've seen a lot of or</i>
<i>games come and go.</i>

37
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,735
<i>Kind of sad. I think about al</i>
<i>those guys from</i> asteroids.

38
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,505
<i>Boom! Gone.</i>Centipede?

39
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:22,174
<i>Who knows where</i>
<i>that guy is, you know?</i>

40
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,209
<i>Look, a steady arcade gig</i>
<i>is nothing to sneeze at.</i>

41
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:24,877
<i>I'm very lucky.</i>

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,381
<i>It's just,</i>
<i>I got to say,</i>

43
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:31,750
<i>It becomes kind of hard</i>
<i>to love your job</i>

44
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,452
<i>When no one seems to</i>
<i>like you for doing it.</i>

45
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,192
All clear!
The arcade is closed!

46
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,261
Shoryuken!

47
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:45,931
Whoo! What a day!
You want to head
to tappers, ken?

48
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:46,899
If you're buying, buddy.

49
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,204
Felix:
Quitting time!

50
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,718
Ralph:  <i>I don't know.</i>

51
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,320
<i>Maybe I wouldn't be</i>
<i>feeling this way</i>

52
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,555
<i>If things were</i>
<i>different after work.</i>

53
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:12,424
<i>But it is what it is.</i>

54
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,725
Good job, everyone!

55
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,427
Ralph:
<i>Felix and the nicelanders</i>

56
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,596
<i>Go hang out in their homs</i>

57
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,464
<i>Which he's just fixed,</i>
<i>and everyone, you know.</i>

58
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:25,204
<i>They go to their homes,</i>
<i>I go to mine</i>

59
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:27,739
<i>Which happens</i>
<i>to be a dump.</i>

60
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:29,641
<i>And when I say "a dump,"</i>

61
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:30,842
<i>I don't mean like</i>
<i>a shabby place.</i>

62
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,545
<i>I mean an actual dump,</i>

63
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,248
<i>Where the garbage goes</i>

64
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,650
<i>And a bunch of bricks</i>
<i>and smashed building parts.</i>

65
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,854
<i>That's what I call home.</i>

66
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,756
<i>I guess I can't</i>
<i>bellyache too much.</i>

67
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,391
<i>I got my bricks,</i>
<i>I got my stump.</i>

68
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,398
<i>It looks uncomfortable.</i>
<i>It's actually fine. I'm go.</i>

69
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,008
<i>But if I'm really</i>
<i>honest with myself...</i>

70
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,312
<i>I see felix up there</i>
<i>getting patted on the back,</i>

71
00:04:07,314 --> 00:04:11,416
<i>People are giving him pie</i>
<i>and thanking him</i>

72
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,319
<i>And so happy</i>
<i>to see him all the time.</i>

73
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,755
Sometimes I think...

74
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:21,393
Man, it sure must be nice
being the good guy.

75
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,996
(all clapping)

76
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,332
Blinky: Nice share, ralph.

77
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,867
As fellow bad guys,

78
00:04:28,869 --> 00:04:30,569
We've all felt
what you're feeling

79
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:31,903
And we've come
to terms with it.

80
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:32,704
Really?
Zangief: Right here.

81
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,407
I am zangief.
I am bad guy.

82
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,809
All: Hi, zangief!
Hi, zangief.

83
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,712
I relate to you, ralph.
When I hit bottom,

84
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:42,481
I was crushing man's skull

85
00:04:42,483 --> 00:04:44,950
Like sparrow egg
between my thighs.

86
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,685
(all chuckling)

87
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:49,755
And I think, "why do you have
to be so bad, zangief?

88
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,990
"why can't you be
more like good guy?"

89
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,826
Then I have
moment of clarity.

90
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:56,795
If zangief is good guy,

91
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,964
Who'll crush man's skull

92
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,400
Like sparrow's egg
between thighs?

93
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:03,535
And I say, "zangief,
you are bad guy,

94
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:06,371
"but this does not mean
you are 'bad' guy."

95
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,973
(grunts in approval)

96
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,978
Right. I'm sorry.
You lost me there.

97
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,379
Zombie! Bad guy!
All: Hi, zombie.

98
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,415
Hi, zombie.

99
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,318
Zangief saying
labels not make you happy.

100
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,553
Good! Bad!

101
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,821
(growls)

102
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,390
You must love you.

103
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,893
Yeah! Inside here!
Yes.

104
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,662
Okay. All right, I get you.
Watch out. It's dripping.

105
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:32,397
Question, ralph.

106
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,900
We've been asking you
to bad-anon for years now

107
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,803
And tonight you
finally show up.

108
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,571
Why is that?
I don't know.

109
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,640
I just felt like coming.

110
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:45,944
I suppose it has
something to do with
the fact that, uh...

111
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,980
Well, today is the 30th
anniversary of my game.

112
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,682
Well, happy anniversary,
ralph.

113
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,417
Thanks, satan.

114
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,853
Uh, it's sateen,
actually.

115
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,822
Got it.
But here's the thing.

116
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:57,689
(sighs)

117
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,460
I don't want to be
the bad guy anymore.

118
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:02,594
(all exclaiming)

119
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,099
You can't mess with
the program, ralph.

120
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,968
You're not going turbo,
are you?

121
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,772
Turbo? No, I'm not going
turbo! Come on, guys!

122
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,475
Is it turbo to want a friend?
Or a medal?

123
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,543
Or a piece of pie
every once in a while?

124
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,711
Is it turbo to want
more out of life?

125
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,613
Yes!

126
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,715
Ralph, ralph, we get it.

127
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,550
But we can't change
who we are.

128
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,053
And the sooner
you accept that,

129
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,989
The better off your game
and your life will be.

130
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:34,659
Hey. One game
at a time, ralph.

131
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:35,727
Let's close out with
the bad guy affirmation.

132
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:44,069
All: I'm bad,
and that's good.

133
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,839
I will never be good,
and that's not bad.

134
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,574
There's no one
I'd rather be than me.

135
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,178
Blinky: Okay, gang,
see you next week.

136
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,980
M. Bison: Listen, I can't do
snacks next week.

137
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,982
Hang in there, ralph.

138
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,984
Blinky: Hey, zombie,
don't forget your hatchets.

139
00:06:58,986 --> 00:06:59,851
There you go.

140
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,621
(female announcer
announcing on pa)

141
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,913
(alarm blaring)
(grunts in frustration)

142
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,915
Step aside, sir.
Random security check.

143
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,151
Random my behind!
You always stop me.

144
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,253
I'm just a surge protector
doing my job, sir.

145
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,055
Name?
Lara croft.

146
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,857
Name?
Wreck-it ralph!

147
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:13,024
And where are you
coming from?

148
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,793
Uh...  <i>Pac-man</i> .

149
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,027
Did you bring
any fruit with you?

150
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,896
No! No. No fruit.

151
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:18,964
Okay, then.
Where are you heading?

152
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,565
<i>Fix-it felix jr.</i>

153
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:22,167
Anything to declare?
I hate you.

154
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,668
I get that a lot.
Proceed.

155
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,741
Bad guy coming!
(screaming)

156
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,512
Sonic the hedgehog:
<i>If you leave your game,</i>

157
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,814
<i>Stay safe, stay alert,</i>

158
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,550
<i>And whatever you,</i>
<i>don't die.</i>

159
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:40,185
<i>Because if you die</i>
<i>outside your own game</i>

160
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,820
<i>You don't regenerate.</i>

161
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,221
<i>Ever. Game ove.</i>

162
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,566
Here you go, buddy.

163
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,271
It's fresh.
Straight from pac-man's.

164
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,139
Hang in there, guys.

165
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,207
(alarm blaring)
name?

166
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,241
(grunts in frustration)

167
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,710
(dance music playing)

168
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:15,053
<i>♪ celebrate good times</i>
<i>come on! ♪</i>

169
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,692
(bell ringing)

170
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,665
(fireworks exploding)

171
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,267
(fireworks whistling)

172
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,613
"happy 30th anniversary"?

173
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:42,314
They're having
a party without me.

174
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:48,753
Pac-man?
They invited pac-man?

175
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,956
That cherry-chasing
dot-muncher

176
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:51,990
Isn't even part of this game!

177
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,159
Great party, felix.

178
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:56,061
Why, thank you, friend.

179
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:57,162
Felix. You're needed on
the dance floor!

180
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,966
(whooping)

181
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,167
All: Whoo!

182
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,172
Nicelanders: Fix-it felix!
Whoo-whoo! Fix-it felix!

183
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,240
(doorbell rings)

184
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:10,609
Oh! I'll bet that's mario.

185
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:13,044
Fashionably late,
per the norm.

186
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,245
I'll get it, felix.

187
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:15,347
(humming)

188
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,750
Ahh!
(music stops)

189
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,686
It's ralph!

190
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,254
(screaming)
he'll wreck the party!

191
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,623
Hide the stemware!

192
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,790
Get rid of him, felix.

193
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,326
Oh, right.
I'll go talk to him.

194
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:30,228
Carry on, everyone.

195
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,930
(music starts again)

196
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,299
Ralph, can I help you?

197
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,934
Hey, felix.
Just wanted to check on you.

198
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,236
I saw a big explosion

199
00:10:38,238 --> 00:10:40,805
Or something go
over the building there.

200
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,208
Oh, those were
just fireworks.

201
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,242
Fireworks. Okay. Phewf.

202
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,945
Somebody's birthday, or...

203
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:50,649
Well, it's more
of an anniversary.

204
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,418
The 30th anniversary
of our game, actually.

205
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,720
What? Is that today?

206
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:56,988
I know!

207
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,757
Oh, I'm such
a dummy with dates.

208
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,059
Anyway, uh,
congratulations.

209
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,295
Thank you, ralph.
And to you, too.

210
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:05,664
(chuckles)
(chuckles awkwardly)

211
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:09,234
Uh...

212
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,271
Hi. Just a heads-up, felix.

213
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,673
They're bringing out the cake
in a few shakes.

214
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,207
Hey, glen.
Ralph.

215
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,212
Cake? Heard about this
cake stuff. (chuckles)

216
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,814
Never had it.

217
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,082
No one ever seems
to throw it out

218
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,417
So it never ends up
in the dump.

219
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,753
I never actually
tasted it. Uh...

220
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,255
I've always
wanted to try cake.

221
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,725
I don't suppose
you'd like to

222
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,093
Come in and have
a slice, would you?

223
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,729
Hey-o, everybody!
Oh!

224
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:38,396
Ah!

225
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:40,899
(all gasp)

226
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:47,072
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Fit as a fiddle.

227
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,240
(all exhaling)
now, you all know ralph.

228
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,342
Evening.
(all gasp)

229
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:54,779
Evening, nell, lucy,
don, dana...

230
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,448
Deanna.
Ralph: Big gene!

231
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,183
Why is he here?

232
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,752
He's just here
for a slice of cake.

233
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,120
And I'm a big
part of the game,

234
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,089
Technically speaking.

235
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,724
Why are you here, gene?

236
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,958
Oh, look! The cake!

237
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,394
(gasps)

238
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:13,998
Well, I'll be dipped. You've
really outdone yourself, mary.

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,768
Norwood: Oh, and look!
There's all of us at the top.

240
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,504
Each apartment
is everyone's
favorite flavor.

241
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,206
Norwood's is red velvet.

242
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,841
Norwood: Guilty!

243
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:26,144
And lemon for lucy,
rum cake for gene,

244
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,045
And for felix...
Hey, mary.

245
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,280
Um...

246
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:32,117
What's the flavor of that mud
that I'm stuck in there?

247
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:35,520
Hmm? Oh. Chocolate.

248
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:37,856
I've never been
real fond of chocolate.

249
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,791
Well, I did not
know that.

250
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,292
One other little thing.

251
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:44,763
I hate to be picky, but
this angry little guy here...

252
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,865
My cake!
...Might be a lot happier

253
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,032
If you put him up here
with everyone else.

254
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,302
See that?
Look at that smile.

255
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:53,805
No, no. You see, ralph,

256
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,173
There's no room
for you up here.

257
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,444
(chuckles) what about this?
We can make room.

258
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,980
Here. We could
take turns. Easy.

259
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,281
(all gasp)

260
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,283
How about we just
eat the cake?

261
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,519
Hang on. Felix needs
to be on the roof

262
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,854
Because he's about
to get his medal!

263
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,956
Then how about we just
take that medal

264
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,424
And give it to ralph for once?

265
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,326
Would that be the
end of the world, gene?

266
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,928
Now you're just
being ridiculous.

267
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,863
Only good guys win medals,

268
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:21,432
And you, sir,
are no good guy.

269
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:22,834
I could be a good guy
if I wanted to,

270
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,335
And I could win a medal!

271
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,438
Uh-huh. And when you do,
come and talk to us.

272
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,841
Then would you finally
let me be on top of
the cake with you guys?

273
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,242
If you won a medal,

274
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,944
We'd let you live
up here in the penthouse!

275
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:35,547
But it will
never happen

276
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,183
Because you're just the bad
guy who wrecks the building.

277
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,584
No, I'm not.

278
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:40,952
Yes, you are!

279
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,887
No, I'm not!

280
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,289
(all exclaim)

281
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,156
(gasps)

282
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,998
Yes, you are.

283
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,870
All right, gene.
You know what?

284
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,471
I'm going to win a medal.

285
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:03,141
Oh, I am going to
win a medal!

286
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,877
The shiniest medal
this place has ever seen!

287
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,446
A medal that
will be so good

288
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,915
That it will make felix's
medals wet their pants!

289
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,452
And good night!
Thank you for the party.

290
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,122
Is he serious?
Oh, please!

291
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:20,024
Where's a bad guy
going to win a medal?

292
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,527
Of course
he's not serious.

293
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,630
I've never been more serious
about anything in my life.

294
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,332
That's why I came
straight here, tapper.

295
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,267
You've never given me
a bum steer.

296
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:33,137
Now, come on. Where can a guy
like me go and win a medal?

297
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,406
I don't think such
a game exists, ralph.

298
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:38,176
Oh, come on. You know people.
There's got to be...

299
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,143
Male customer:
Tapper, I need a root beer.

300
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,645
Coming!
Hold that thought.

301
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,380
(video game music playing)

302
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,621
Okay. As you were saying.

303
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,523
I was saying, I can't spend
another 30 years

304
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,225
Living alone in the garbage.

305
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,127
I'm not going back
without a medal.

306
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,562
Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

307
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,231
Maybe somebody
left a medal here.

308
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,200
You're welcome to dig
through the lost and found.

309
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:05,236
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

310
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,938
Oh! Shoo! Shoo!
Go on, get out of here.

311
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,909
Mushroom? No.

312
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,411
What is this? No.

313
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,448
Oh, come on, zangief!
Gross.

314
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,384
(sighs) oh.

315
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,219
What am I doing?

316
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,688
(grunts)

317
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,124
Hey, excuse you!
We are humanity's last hope.

318
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,525
Our mission?
Destroy all cy-bugs.

319
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,162
We are humanity's
last hope.

320
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:34,365
Uh... You okay there,
space cadet?

321
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,334
We've only been
plugged in a week

322
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:39,637
And every day it's, "climb
the building, then fight bugs.

323
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,706
"climb the building,
fight more bugs!"

324
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,474
Yeah, yeah. Right. Look.

325
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,510
Easy on the overalls,
spaceman.

326
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,078
It's tough all over,
all right?

327
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,280
And all for what?
A lousy medal?

328
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,383
Medal? You win a medal?

329
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,352
Yeah, medal of heroes.

330
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,954
Ooh. Is it shiny?

331
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,323
Pretty shiny.

332
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,224
Ooh! And it says
"hero" on it?

333
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:01,492
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah.

334
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,695
And you say you win it
by climbing a building?

335
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:05,596
And fighting bugs!
Right, bugs.

336
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,099
Is there any chance I could go
with you to your game

337
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,335
And maybe get
one of those medals?

338
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:12,270
Negatory.
Does that mean maybe?

339
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,472
No! Look,
only the bravest

340
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,241
And the best
serve in our corps.

341
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,309
Bug!

Okay. All right.
What was it called again?

Morning, kids.
Come on in.

Now listen up, because I'm
only going to say this once.

Fear is

Wait a second! Aah!

Cy-bug, twelve o'clock.

No cuts, no butts,
no coconuts?

Never interfere with
the first-person shooter.

430
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,501
Our job is to get the gamers
to the top of that building

So they can get a medal,

Ralph? Ralph!

Oh, my land!
Where is he?

What's the trouble,

463
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,504

466
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,978
Looks like the game's
gone cuckoo, like my nana.

467
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:30,114
Sorry, sweetie.
Here's your quarter back.

468
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:31,982
But what about the game?

469
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,684
I'll have someone
look at it tomorrow...

470
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,719
But if he can't fix it,

471
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:36,087
It might be time

472
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,722
To put old ralph
and felix out to pasture.

473

Sweet mercy!
Without ralph, we're doomed!

477

Okay, everybody, calm down.

480
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,850
Ralph probably fell asleep

481
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:06,751
In the washroom
of tapper's again.

482

see? There he is now.

483
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,462
Why, it's qbert. What brings
you here, neighbor?

486
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:24,502
Stand by. My qbert-ese

Hello.

Man, you scared me, kid.

Uh... Ralph.
Wreck-it ralph.

You're not from here,

No, well, yeah. I mean,
not from right in this area.

What kind of work?

Some routine
candy tree trimming.

You probably
want to stand back.

No. I'm not a hobo,

the medal. That is my medal!

638
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:29,620
What was that, now?
What are you, thick?

639
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,054
There was a cy-bug
on that shuttle!

640
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,359
Do you even know
what a cy-bug is?

641
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:36,660
I can't say
that I do, ma'am.

642
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,662
Cy-bugs are like a virus.

643
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:40,430
They don't know
they're in a game.

644
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:43,467
All they know is eat,
kill, multiply.

645
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:45,235
Without a beacon
to stop them,

646
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,304
They'll consume  <i>sugar rush.</i>

647
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,605
But do you think
they'll stop there?

648
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:50,240
Yes!
Wrong!

649
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,243
Viruses do not stop!

650
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,146
Once those cy-bugs
finish off  <i>sugar rush,</i>

651
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:59,283
They'll invade every other
game until this arcade

652
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:03,353
Is nothing but a smoking husk
of forgotten dreams.

653
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,223
Kohut! My cruiser.

654
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:12,462
Jeepers. Is she
always this intense?

655
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,631
It's not her fault.

656
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:17,968
She's programmed with the most
tragic back-story ever.

657
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,469
The one day she didn't do
a perimeter check...

658
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,940
<i>Her wedding day.</i>

659
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,579

660
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,183
(screaming)

661
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:41,191
Wait, ma'am!
I'm going with you.

662
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,393
Like fun you are,
short stack.

663
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,195
If you die outside your game,
you don't regenerate.

664
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,966
Well, neither do you, ma'am.

665
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:51,501
And it is my job to fix
what ralph wrecks.

666
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,403
And I cannot ask you

667
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:56,073
To risk your life
cleaning up his mess.

668
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,675
No flex on this one, ma'am.
I am coming along with you.

669
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,580

No. I'm king candy!

What are you doing here?

767
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:14,691
Look, your candiness, this is
just a big misunderstanding.

768
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,626
Just get me
out of this cupcake,

769
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,695
I'll get my medal,
and I'll be out of your way.

Your medal? (laughs)
bad guys don't win medals.

771
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:24,034
Well, this one did.

772
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:25,735
I earned it
over in  <i>hero's duty.</i>

773
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,370
You game-jumped?

774
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,606
Ralph, you're not
going turbo, are you?

775
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:31,574
What? No, no.

776
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:35,345
Because if you think you can
come in here to my kingdom

777
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:37,347
And take over my game, you've
got another thing coming!

00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:39,349
Easy, your puffiness.

It's not my fault

00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,424
The glitch!

783
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:49,392
The coin she used to buy
her way into the race.

784
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:50,694
That was your medal?

785
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:53,096
She did what?
I need that back!

786
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,498
Well, I'm afraid I can't
help you. It's gone, you know.

787
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,702
It's nothing but code now.

788
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:01,338
It will stay that way until
someone wins the cup

789

At the end of the race.

790
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,008
Maybe I'll have
to have a little talk

791
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,409
With the winner then.

792
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:07,811
Is that a threat I smell?

793
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:13,116
Beyond the halitosis you
so obviously suffer from.

794
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:16,486
Listen, nilly-wafer, I'm not
leaving without my medal!

795
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:18,455
Yes, you are.

796
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:21,358
Wynnchel, duncan,
get him out of that cupcake

797
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,426
And on the first train
back home.

798
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,928
If I ever see you here again,
wreck-it ralph,

799
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,897
I'll lock you in my fungeon.

800
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,632
Fungeon?

801
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:31,634
Fun dungeon, you know?
It's a play on words.

802
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,704
(chuckles) it's the...

803
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:38,908
Never mind! I've got a glitch
to deal with, thanks to you.

804
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,811
Goodbye, wreck-it ralph!
It hasn't been a pleasure.

805
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:47,751
This thing is hard as a rock.

806
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,018
I can see that.

807
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,620
Get the tools.
What tools?

808
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:51,688
Quiet, you!
Ow!

809
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,492
What? No!

810
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:56,893
Take it easy, big boy!
Stay away from me!

811
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:57,727
He's getting away!

812
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,769
Quick!
Call out the devil dogs.

813
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:06,669
(sniffing)

814
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:09,806
(barking)

815
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,717
(breathing)

816
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:23,486
Chocolate. I hate chocolate!

817
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:27,123
I got to get
my medal back.

818
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,564
The pot goes to
the winning racer!

819
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:35,999
Hey, kids! Can I talk
to you for a second?

820
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:44,874
(tires screeching)

821
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,145
Hello, fellow racers!

822
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:52,515
It's that little
crumb snatcher.

823
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:55,084
Candlehead, taffyta,
rancis, you're looking well.

824
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:57,854
Came by to check out
the competition, huh?

825
00:40:57,856 --> 00:41:00,857
Well, here it is,
the lickety-split!

826
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,725
Sheesh. Looks like
she built it herself.

827
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,194
I built it myself.

828
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:06,663
Fastest pedal-power west
of the whac-a-mole.

829
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:07,597
Check her out.

830
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,133
(honking)

831
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:16,673
Oh, vanellope,
it's so... You.

832
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:17,974
(chuckling smugly)

833
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,777
But you have to back
out of the race. Yeah.

834
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:22,745
Oh, no, I don't,

835
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:25,615
Because I paid my fee
and I'm on the board...

836
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:27,884
So, yeah,
I'm definitely racing.

837
00:41:27,886 --> 00:41:30,954
Yeah, well, king candy says
glitches can't race.

838
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:34,524
I'm not a glitch, taffyta.
I've just got pixslexia, okay?

839
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,259
The rules are there
for a reason, vanellope.

840
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:39,696
To protect us.
Say I'm you.

841
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:42,165
I'm in my weird little car
and I'm driving

842
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,901
And I actually feel
kind of cool for once.

843
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:46,903
And then,
all of a sudden, oh, no.

844
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:49,539
I'm (stammering)
glitching!

845
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:51,007
(gasps) hey!
See?

846
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,042
You're an accident
just waiting to happen.

847
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:55,678
Oh, no!
I (stammers) glitched, too!

848
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,815
Uncool.

849
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:00,817
Stop it! Stop!
You're breaking it!

850
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,053
Please!

851
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,823
I just want to
race like you guys.

852
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:09,926
You will never be a racer
because you're a glitch.

853
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:11,561
And that's all
you'll ever be!

854
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,964
Hey! Leave her alone!

855
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,067
(yelling)

856
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19,235
(screaming)

857
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:20,837
Let's get out of here!

858
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,011
Scram,
you rotten little cavities!

859
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:29,112
Before I throw you in the mud!

860
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:37,287
What are you looking at?

861
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:41,758
You're welcome,
you rotten little thief.

862
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,061
I'm not a thief! I just
borrowed your stupid coin.

863
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,697
I was going to give it back to
you as soon as I won the race.

864
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:50,066
It's not a coin.
It is a medal.

865
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:52,602
Coin, medal, whatever.

866
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:54,871
Just go back to your own dumb
game and win another one.

867
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:57,140
I can't. I didn't win it
in my game.

868
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:58,608
I won it in  <i>hero's duty.</i>

869
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,044
<i>Hero's doodie?</i>

870
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,748
It's not that kind of duty.

871
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,784
I bet you really got to watch
where you step

872
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:09,686
In a game called
<i>hero's doodie!</i>

873
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,187
(laughing)

874
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:12,922
What did you win
the medal for, wiping?

875
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:18,261
I hope you washed your hands
after you handled that medal.

876
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:19,696
Listen!
One more, one more.

877
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:21,631
Why did the hero
flush the toilet?

878
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,134
Say "why."
why?

879
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:27,770
Because it was his doodie!

880
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,172
How dare you insult
<i>hero's duty?</i>

881
00:43:29,174 --> 00:43:30,306
You little guttersnipe!

882
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:32,675
I earned that medal

883
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:34,711
And you better get it back
for me toot-sweet, sister!

884
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:36,613
Well, unless you've got
a go-cart

885
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:38,214
Hidden in the fat folds
of your neck,

886
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:39,816
I can't help you!

887
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:41,184
(grunting in frustration)

888
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,190
What a moron.

889
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,927
Hey, genius!
It's a jawbreaker.

890
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:51,928
You're never
going to break...

891
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:55,732
Huh.

892
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:56,699
(panting)

893
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:01,070
Enjoy your little tantrum,
diaper baby?

894
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,939
Leave me alone.

895
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:06,943
Look, you want that medal,
right? And I want to race.

896
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:08,945
So here's what
I'm thinking.

897
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:12,649
You help me get a new cart...
A real cart...

898
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:15,151
And I'll win the race
and get you back your medal.

899
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,054
You want me to help you?

900
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:20,356
All you got to do is
break something for me.

901
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:23,159
Come on.
What do you say, friend?

902
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,260
We are not friends.

903
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:29,232
Oh, come on, pal.
You son of a gun.

904
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:31,000
Come on, buddy.
Let's shake on it.

905
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,936
Ah. Come on, chumbo.

906
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:36,072
Ralph, my man.
My main man.

907
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:38,841
Hey!

908
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,144
My arm's getting tired.
Do we have a deal or not?

909
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,814
(grunts) you better win.

910
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,286
Well, I'll say this much,

911
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:51,854
They don't call your friend
"wreck-it" for nothing.

912
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,691
There's the shuttle.

913
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:58,995
Is he in there?

914
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:03,032
Nope. Lucky for him.

915
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,001
Otherwise I would have
slapped his corpse.

916
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:08,838
No cy-bug, either.

917
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,374
Got to find it before
it lays its filthy eggs.

918
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,744
It came this way,

919
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:16,145
But the sugar particles
in the atmosphere

920
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:17,880
Are jamming my sensor.

921
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,716
Can't get a read on it.

922
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:21,784
So what is it with this
wreck-it joker, huh?

923
00:45:21,786 --> 00:45:22,985
Why did he go awol?

924
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:25,088
I wish I knew, ma'am.

925
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,790
He was acting
all squirrelly last night...

926
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:30,460
Going on about
cake and medals...

927
00:45:30,462 --> 00:45:33,229
But I never thought
he'd go turbo.

928
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:34,931
"go turbo"?

929
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:37,967
That's right,
you guys just
got plugged in.

930
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:41,304
Well, back when the arcade
first opened,

931
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:44,073
Turbo time  <i>was by far</i>
<i>the most popular game.</i>

932
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,809
<i>And turbo...</i>
<i>Turbo-tastic!</i>

933
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:49,412
<i>He loved the attention.</i>
<i>Turbo-tastic!</i>

934
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:52,248
<i>So, whe</i>roadblasters
<i>got plugged in</i>

935
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,816
<i>And stole turbo's thunder..</i>

936
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:55,318
New game. All right!

937
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,919
<i>Boy, was he jealous.</i>

938
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:02,058
<i>So jealous that he</i>
<i>abandoned his game</i>

939
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,227
<i>And tried to take</i>
<i>over the new one.</i>

940
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:05,828
Player 1: These
are the greatest
graphics I've ever seen!

941
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:06,462
<i>Turbo-tastic!</i>

942
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:11,267
Player 2: Hey. Is that...
That looks like turbo.

943
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,237
Player 1: What's turbo doing
in this game? Aw, come on!

944
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,104
Player 2: Mr. Litwak!

945
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:20,243
Felix:  <i>Turbo ended up putting</i>
<i>both games and himself</i>

946
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:24,247
<i>Out of order, for good.</i>

947
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:27,016
Yes, the selfish man
is like a mangy dog

948
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:28,851
Chasing a cautionary tale.

949
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:29,986
I know, right?

950
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,389
That's why I have
to get ralph home

951
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,224
Or the same thing's gonna
happen to my game.

952
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:36,225
(bleeping)
huh?

953
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,561
(grunts)

954
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:39,929
(both exclaiming)

955
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:41,063
What is this?

956
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:45,434
"nesquik sand"?
Quicksand?

957
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:47,937
Oh, I'll hop out and grab you
one of those vines.

958
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:49,205
(grunts) huh!

959
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:50,807
(grunts)

960
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:53,442
(grunting)

961
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:56,913
I can't hop. I'm hop-less.
This is hopeless!

962
00:46:56,915 --> 00:46:58,114
We're going to drown here.

963
00:46:58,116 --> 00:46:59,582
Stop thrashing.
Stop moving.

964
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:00,583
You're making us sink faster.

965
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:01,851
We're going to die!

966
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:03,019
Get ahold of yourself!

967
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,421
(laughter)

968
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,593
Felix: The vines.
They're laffy taffy.

969
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:12,829
They're attracted to whatever
makes them laugh.

970
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:13,996
Here, hit me again.

971
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:16,833
(all groan)

972
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,903
That's not funny enough.
Harder!

973
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:22,605
Look, you're a nice guy.
I can't...

974
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:25,408
No, ma'am! The arcade
is depending on us.

975
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,277
Now do your duty.
That's an ord...

976
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:29,846
Oh!
(laughing)

977
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,148
It's working!
Hit me again.

978
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:34,116
Ooh, your eye.

979
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,153
I can fix it. Now...

980
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,157
Oh! San fran-tastic! Again!

981
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:43,426
Ow! You mean business!

982
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,429
Ow! Yikes on bikes!

983
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,267
Wow! We're...
Killing... Them!

984
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:53,569
Comedy gold!

985
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,318
(whimsical singing)

986
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:22,231
All right, enough with
the goo-goo eyes.

987
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,266
We've got work to do.
Let's go.

988
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,235
(beeping)

989
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,504
Ugh. We lost the cy-bug.

990
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:30,306
Come on. We'll get
a better view from the air.

991
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:31,340
You think you can
fix that shuttle?

992
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:33,442
Can do.

993
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:49,625
(snoring)

994
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:51,160
Shh!

995
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,404
All right, do your thing,
knuckles. Bust it open!

996
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:04,140
What's this? You're a full-on
criminal, aren't you?

997
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:05,508
Hey, we shook on it.

998
00:49:06,376 --> 00:49:07,276
(sighs)

999
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,080
Thank you, jeeves.

1000
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,551
What is this place?
Where are the carts?

1001
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:16,719
You gotta make one.

1002
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:18,321
What? No, no.

1003
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:20,456
Look, kid, bad idea.
Trust me.

1004
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:23,025
I don't make things.
I break things.

1005
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:24,527
Well, it looks like
you're going to be
stepping outside

1006
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:26,329
Your comfort zone,
then, gladys.

1007
00:49:26,331 --> 00:49:28,664
Ooh, this is a good one!

1008
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:32,335
Announcer:  <i>Welcome to</i>

another game?

1010
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:35,371
Vanellope: Yeah, well,
it's a mini-game.

Underpants. No, no!

1018
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:48,284
You're getting
all the wrong stuff, kid.

1019
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:50,619
I'm trying!

1020
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:54,357
Let me up there.
I'll do it. No. Yes.

1021
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,025
Gross. Milk.
Yes, yes, yes. Oh!

00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:13,509
I'm on it.

1029
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,314
Yeah, no problem.
Give me this thing here.

1030
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,318
Vanellope: Okay, good.
Little more.

1031
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,720
Yeah, that's it!
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1032
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,423

Fifteen seconds!

Announcer:  <i>Decorating!</i>
<i>Wheels first.</i>

How many?
Four, doy!

1036
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:34,463
Got it. (grunting)

1037
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,434
Now frosting.
A buttload of frosting!

1038
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:39,201
No problem.

1039
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:46,609
Oh.

1042
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,062
(ralph exclaiming)

1043
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:12,601
Look, kid...
I tried to warn you.

1044
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:15,237
I can't make things.
I just break...

1045
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,439
I love it.

1046
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,607
You do?

1047
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,376
I love it.

1048
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:22,445
I love it!
I love it! I love it!

1049
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:24,213
Look, it's got a real engine!

1050
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:25,281
And look at these wheels.

1051
00:51:25,283 --> 00:51:27,349
(kissing)

1052
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:30,786
I love it!
I finally have a real cart!

1053
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:34,523
Come on. A work of art
like this must be signed.

1054
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,326
(snores)

1055
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:38,227
Cream puffs.

1056
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,464
(grunts) hmm?

1057
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:42,364
(sniffing)

1058
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:48,170
(gasps) this is beard papa.

1059
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:50,139
The glitch is in the bakery!
Get me king candy!

1060
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,847
Oh, what? You have teeth?

1061
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:00,449
I don't think I've ever
seen you smile before.

1062
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,419
I'm not smiling.
I was...
I'm gassy, okay?

1063
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,653
(laughs)

1064
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,658
Hold it right there, glitch!
(gasps)

1065
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,826
And wreck-it ralph?
Uh-oh.

1066
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,262
(exclaims)

1067
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:14,797
Start the cart!
Start the cart!

1068
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,200
What are you waiting for?
Come on. Let's go!

1069
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:22,338
I don't know how to
drive a real cart.

1070
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,739
You don't what?

1071
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,441
Are you hurt, sire?

1072
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:28,611
No, he just glazed me.
Get them!

1073
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:29,845
Gangway!
Oh!

1074
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,750
Ah!

1075
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:37,520
Stop, in the name of the king!
That's me!

1076
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:38,454
(siren wailing)

1077
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,325
Get off the road!

1078
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,261
(tires screeching)

1079
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:50,432
Head for diet cola mountain!

1080
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,872
Drive into the wall!
What?

1081
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:59,508
Right there, between the two
sugar-free lollipops!

1082
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:01,277
Are you crazy?
Just do it!

1083
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,547
(screaming)

1084
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:09,485
Oh!

1085
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,625
Where did they go?
They should have just turned.

1086
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,830
Find that glitch!
Destroy that cart!

1087
00:53:21,832 --> 00:53:23,766
She can't be allowed to race!

1088
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:32,975
So let me get this straight.
You don't know how to drive.

1089
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,944
Well, no, not technically.

1090
00:53:34,946 --> 00:53:36,912
I just thought that...
What did you think?

1091
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:40,216
"oh, I'll just magically
win the race

1092
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:41,483
"just because
I really want to!"

1093
00:53:41,485 --> 00:53:43,786
Look, wise guy.
I know I'm a racer.

1094
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:45,754
I can feel it in my code.

1095
00:53:45,756 --> 00:53:47,923
(grunts in frustration)

1096
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:50,793
That's it! I'm never
getting my medal back.

1097
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:53,929
What is the big whoop about
that crummy medal anyway?

1098
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:55,564
The big whoop?

1099
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,000
Well, this may come as a shock
to you, but in my game,

1100
00:53:58,002 --> 00:54:00,336
I'm the bad guy
and I live in the garbage.

1101
00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:02,571
Cool.
No. Not cool.

1102
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:06,375
Unhygienic and lonely
and boring.

1103
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:09,945
And that crummy medal
was going to change all that.

1104
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:11,814
I go home with that baby
around my neck

1105
00:54:11,816 --> 00:54:13,749
And I'll get a penthouse.
Pies.

1106
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,784
Ice sculptures. Fireworks!

1107
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,654
(grunts)

1108
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:20,422
It's grown-up stuff.
You wouldn't understand.

1109
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,491
No, I get it!

1110
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:24,727
That's exactly what racing
would do for me!

1111
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:26,528
Well, guess what?
What?

1112
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,697
News flash! Neither one of us
is getting what we want!

1113
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:30,833
(explosion)

1114
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,435
What was that?

1115
00:54:46,316 --> 00:54:48,751
"diet cola hot springs."

1116
00:54:48,753 --> 00:54:50,586
"watch out for
falling mentos."

1117
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:51,587
Yeah! Check it out. Look!

1118
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:57,026
Oh!

1119
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,496
Ow! Whoa!

1120
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:01,930
You got to watch out
for the splash.

1121
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:03,766
That stuff is broiling hot.

1122
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:04,867
Ralph: Yeah, I got that.
Thank you.

1123
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,037
What is this dump?

1124
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:11,774
I think it's some sort of
unfinished bonus level.

1125
00:55:11,776 --> 00:55:13,876
Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

1126
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:17,313
I found that secret opening,
and now I live here.

1127
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:18,580
See? Oh, look, look, look.

1128
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:22,584
Welcome to my home!

1129
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:24,853
I sleep in these
candy wrappers.

1130
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:27,323
I bundle myself up like
a little homeless lady.

1131
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:29,725
By yourself?

1132
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:32,661
With all this garbage
around you?

1133
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,565
Well, yeah.

1134
00:55:36,567 --> 00:55:38,667
I mean, everyone here says
I'm just a mistake

1135
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,669
And that I wasn't
even supposed to exist.

1136
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,471
What do you expect?

1137
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:44,940
Listen, kid...

1138
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:47,509
I know it's none
of my business

1139
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:50,446
But why do you even
stick around this game?

1140
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:52,648
You really don't know
anything, do you?

1141
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,049
Glitches can't
leave their games.

1142
00:55:56,386 --> 00:55:58,587
It's one of the joys
of being me.

1143
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,799
Hey, what are you doing?
Come on!

1144
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:13,068
I know it's a dump,
but it's all I got.

1145
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,670
If you're going to be
a racer,

1146
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:16,505
You're going to have
to learn how to drive.

1147
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:18,640
And you can't do that
without a track.

1148
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:24,780
Whoa!

1149
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:26,648
All right, now.

1150
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,684
Let's hustle up.
We've got some driving to do.

1151
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:30,786
I'm going to learn to drive!
I'm going to learn to drive!

1152
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:32,488
Oh, wait.
Do you know how to drive?

1153
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:34,590
Yeah! I mean,
I haven't done it, but...

1154
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:35,858
Look, I flew
a spaceship today, okay?

1155
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,493
You crashed it.

1156
00:56:37,495 --> 00:56:40,129
Just get in. How hard
can it be? Okay, uh...

1157
00:56:40,131 --> 00:56:41,163
Start it up.

1158
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,133
(engine starting)

1159
00:56:44,135 --> 00:56:47,703
There we go. So there are
some buttons on the floor.

1160
00:56:47,705 --> 00:56:49,738
Pedals.
Pedals. Right.

1161
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:54,676
Now, uh,
that's the go pedal.

1162
00:56:54,678 --> 00:56:57,913
That I believe is the stopper.

1163
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:01,850
And this... Wait.

1164
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:04,186
What is this?
That doesn't do anything.

1165
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:05,120
Ooh, what does this
joystick do?

1166
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:09,992

Yes. Yes, that's him!

01:01:56,847 --> 01:01:59,214
We should have locked him up

1249
01:01:59,216 --> 01:02:01,016

1256
01:02:14,932 --> 01:02:17,899
I mean, I have dreamt about it
for so long, and now...

1257
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,901
And now... Now I think I'm
going to puke, actually.

1258
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,436
I mean, I think I might puke.

1259
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:23,071
You know, like a "vurp."
a what?

1260
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:25,240
Vomit and a burp together,

1261
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:27,175
And you can taste it,
and it's just like rising up.

1262
01:02:27,177 --> 01:02:28,910
Oh, this is so exciting!

1263
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,479
Yes, it is. It's exciting.

1265
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,317
Ralph, what if the gamers
don't like me?

1266
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:39,187

with dirty hair? Come on.

1267
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:42,858
Those people are going
to love you. You know why?

1268
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,960
Because you're a winner.
I'm a winner.

1269
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:47,829
And you're adorable!
I'm adorable!

1270
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:49,264
And everyone loves
an adorable winner!

1271
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:50,999
Yeah!

1272
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:53,468
Okay, come on.
Listen to me.

1273
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:56,772
If you get nervous,
just keep telling yourself,

1274
01:02:56,774 --> 01:03:01,143
"I must win ralph's medal
or his life will be ruined."

1275
01:03:01,145 --> 01:03:02,444
And have fun. Got it?
Got it.

1276
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,312
Whoa!

1277
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:06,114
Oh, wait!

1278
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,015
(brakes screeching)

1279
01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:08,350
Hold on!

1280
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:09,985
Where are you going?

1281
01:03:09,987 --> 01:03:11,086
I forgot something!
I'll be right back!

1282
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:13,889
(chuckles)

1283
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:14,556
Kids.

1284
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,226
(honking)

1285
01:03:18,228 --> 01:03:20,328
Ralph! (chuckles)
there you are. Hello!

1286
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:23,532
You!
I come alone, unarmed.

1287
01:03:23,534 --> 01:03:26,001
I've had enough of you,
pillow pants!

1288
01:03:26,003 --> 01:03:27,435
Please. Calm down!
Please, look. Don't!

1289
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:29,037
(shuddering)

1290
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,506
I'm going to beat
the filling out of you!

1291
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:34,109
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you? Ha!

1292
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:37,479
You hit a guy with glasses.
That's... Well played.

1293
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,815
(gasps)
what do you want, candy?

1294
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:41,483
Listen, I just want to
talk to you.

1295
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:44,953
I'm not interested in anything
you have to say.

1296
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:48,323
How about this?
Are you interested in this?

1297
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:50,826
My medal. How did you...

1298
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:54,129
It doesn't matter.
It's yours! Go ahead, take it.

1299
01:03:54,131 --> 01:03:54,963
(chuckles)

1300
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,531
Whoa.

1301
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:00,268
All I ask
is that you hear me out.

1302
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:02,137
About what?

1303
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:04,573
Ralph, do you know
what the hardest part

1304
01:04:04,575 --> 01:04:06,842
About being a king is?

1305
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:09,277
Doing what's right,
no matter what.

1306
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:10,412
Get to the point.

1307
01:04:10,414 --> 01:04:13,248
Point being, I need your help.

1308
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:17,552
Sad as it is, vanellope
cannot be allowed to race.

1309
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:19,988
Why are you people
so against her?

1310
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:22,891
I'm not against her!
I'm trying to protect her!

1311
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:24,292
If vanellope wins that race

1312
01:04:26,095 --> 01:04:28,563
<i>She'll be added</i>
<i>to the race roster.</i>

1313
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:31,032
<i>Then gamers can choose her</i>
<i>as their avatar.</i>

1314
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:34,469
<i>And when</i>
<i>they see her glitching</i>

1315
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:37,372
<i>And twitching</i>
<i>and just being herself,</i>

1316
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,506
<i>They'll think our game</i>
<i>is broken.</i>

1317
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,910
<i>We'll be put</i>
<i>out of order for good.</i>

1318
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,981
<i>All my subjects</i>
<i>will be homeless.</i>

1319
01:04:45,983 --> 01:04:48,350
(shouting)

1320
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:52,220
<i>But there's one who cannot</i>
<i>escape because she's a glitc.</i>

1321
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:55,290
Help! Somebody, help! Help!

1322
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:57,259
King candy:  <i>And when</i>
<i>the game's plug is pulle.</i>

1323
01:04:57,261 --> 01:04:58,326
(screams) no!

1324
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,663
...She'll die with it.

1325
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,333
You don't know
that will happen.

1326
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:06,334
The gamers could love her.

1327
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,470
And if they don't?

1328
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:18,513
I know it's tough,

1329
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:21,082
But heroes have to make
the tough choices, don't they?

1330
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:28,123
She can't race, ralph,
but she won't listen to me.

1331
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:30,425
So can I count on you to talk
a little sense into her?

1332
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,330
Very good.

1333
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:37,966
I'll give you two
some time alone.

1334
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:04,426
(sighs)

1335
01:06:04,428 --> 01:06:05,360
I'm back!

1336
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,563
Did you miss me?

1337
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:12,400
Yeah... Uh...
Can we talk for a second?

1338
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:14,970
Wait. First, kneel down.

1339
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:16,538
What? No, we really...
Will you just do it?

1340
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,373
Okay.

1341
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:23,044
Now, close your eyes.
Vanellope...

1342
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:24,145
Shush! Close them!

1343
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:25,547
(exhales)

1344
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,284
Okay. Open them up.

1345
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:35,423
"to stinkbrain."
gee, thanks.

1346
01:06:35,425 --> 01:06:36,291
Turn it over.

1347
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:41,062
I made it for you.

1348
01:06:41,064 --> 01:06:43,198
Just in case we don't win.

1349
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,200
Not that I think there's even
a remote chance

1350
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:46,368
We're not going to win.

1351
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:49,504
Thanks, kid. Listen...

1352
01:06:49,506 --> 01:06:53,541
Now rise, my royal chump.
I've got a date with destiny.

1353
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:57,078
Ralph, come on.
Move your molasses.

1354
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,114
Um...

1355
01:06:59,116 --> 01:07:01,683
I've been thinking.
That's dangerous.

1356
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:05,153
Who cares about this
stupid race anyway? Right?

1357
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:07,122
(laughs)
that's not very funny, ralph.

1358
01:07:07,124 --> 01:07:09,224
No, I'm serious,
and it was really fun

1359
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:10,325
To build the car
and everything...

1360
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:13,528
But maybe you shouldn't do it.

1361
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,297
Hello? Is ralph in there?

1362
01:07:16,299 --> 01:07:18,099
I'd like to speak to him,
please.

1363
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:19,701
Look, what I'm saying is
you can't be a racer.

1364
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:20,568
What?

1365
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:23,338
Why would you...

1366
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,241
Wait a minute.

1367
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,209
No!

1368
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,110
Where did you get this?

1369
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:32,614
Look, I'm going to be
straight with you, kid.

1370
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:34,149
I've been talking
to king candy.

1371
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:35,550
King candy?
Yeah.

1372
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,485
You sold me out?

1373
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:39,387
No, I didn't... Listen.
You don't understand.

1374
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:41,656
No, I understand plenty.
Traitor!

1375
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:42,590
I'm not a traitor. Listen.

1376
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:44,626
You're a rat!

1377
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:47,796
And I don't need you, and
I can win the race on my own.

1378
01:07:47,798 --> 01:07:49,464
But I'm trying
to save your skin, kid!

1379
01:07:49,466 --> 01:07:51,366
Put me down! Let me go!

1380
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:52,667
No, you listen to me.

1381
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:54,102
Do you know
what's going to happen

1382
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:56,371
They'll think
the game's broken.

1383
01:07:56,373 --> 01:07:58,273
I don't care!
You're a liar!

1384
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:00,442
You better care, because if
your game goes out of order,

1385
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:01,276
You go down with the ship,
little sister!

1386
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:02,644
I'm not listening to you!

1387
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:05,413
Get out of my way!
I'm going to that race!

1388
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:06,714
No, you're not!

1389
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:08,683
(grunting)

1390
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:12,153
Take me down from here,
ralph, right now!

1391
01:08:12,155 --> 01:08:13,254
No. I'm doing this
for your own good!

1392
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:16,658
Wait, wait, wait.

1393
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:18,560
No. No.

1394
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:20,829
No, no, no, no, no!

1395
01:08:20,831 --> 01:08:22,330
Please, ralph!

1396
01:08:22,332 --> 01:08:24,399
(smashing)
no!

1397
01:08:24,401 --> 01:08:26,301
Stop it! Stop it! No!

1398
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:30,572
(vanellope sobbing)

1399
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:37,812
(ralph panting)

1400
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:45,820
You really are a bad guy.

1401
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:10,311
(bell ringing)

1402
01:09:21,757 --> 01:09:24,626
Hello? Anybody home?

1403
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:28,163
Felix? Mary?

1404
01:09:28,165 --> 01:09:30,732
Well, you actually went
and did it.

1405
01:09:30,734 --> 01:09:33,668
Gene. Where is everybody?

1406
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,837
They're gone.

1407
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:39,207
After felix went to find you
and then didn't come back...

1408
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:41,342
Everyone panicked
and abandoned ship.

1409
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:43,478
But I'm here now.

1410
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,713
It's too late, ralph.

1411
01:09:45,715 --> 01:09:47,448
Litwak's pulling our plug
in the morning.

1412
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:54,756
Oh!

1413
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:02,764
But never let it be said
that I'm not a man of my word.

1414
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,867
The place is yours, ralph.
Enjoy.

1415
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:10,672
Gene, wait! Wait!

1416
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:15,510
Listen, this is not
what I wanted!

1417
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,612
Well, what did you want,
ralph?

1418
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:19,514
I don't know. I just...

1419
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:23,384
(sighs)

1420
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:25,553
I was just tired of
living alone in the garbage.

1421
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,490
Well, now you can live alone
in the penthouse.

1422
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:34,796
(sighs)

1423
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:02,657
(thuds)

1424
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,479
(beeping)

1425
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:36,958
(humming)

1426
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:37,859
Hey, cough drop.

1427
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:40,895
Explain something to me.

1428
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:43,531
If vanellope was
never meant to exist,

1429
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:45,867
Then why is her picture on
the side of the game console?

1430
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:47,368
Uh...

1431
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,370
(shuddering)

1432
01:11:50,406 --> 01:11:51,773
What's going on

1433
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:52,940
In this candy-coated
heart of darkness?

1434
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:54,309
Nothing.

1435
01:11:54,311 --> 01:11:55,543
Talk!
No.

1436
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:56,744
I'll lick you.
You wouldn't.

1437
01:11:56,746 --> 01:11:58,613
Oh, yeah?

1438
01:11:58,615 --> 01:12:00,782
Oh! That's like sandpaper!

1439
01:12:00,784 --> 01:12:03,017
Mmm. Wonder how many
licks it will take

1440
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:04,786
To get to your center.

1441
01:12:04,788 --> 01:12:06,354
I'll take it to my grave!

1442
01:12:06,356 --> 01:12:06,988
Fair enough.

1443
01:12:08,657 --> 01:12:10,725
Oh!

1444
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:12,760
(exclaims) they call you
sour bill for a reason.

1445
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,665
Had enough yet?
Okay, I'll talk, I'll talk!

1446
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,600
Vanellope was a racer

1447
01:12:19,602 --> 01:12:21,936
Until king candy
tried to delete her code!

1448
01:12:21,938 --> 01:12:24,505
Ralph:  <i>Tried to</i>
<i>delete her code?</i>

1449
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:27,108
<i>So that's why she's a glit!</i>
<i>Why is he doing this to he?</i>

1450
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,409
I don't know!

1451
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:29,911
Suit yourself.

1452
01:12:29,913 --> 01:12:32,013
No, no, no!
I swear I don't know!

1453
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:34,615
<i>He literally locked up</i>
<i>our memories</i>

1454
01:12:34,617 --> 01:12:35,883
<i>And I cannot remember!</i>

1455
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:36,818
<i>Nobody can!</i>

1456
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,687
But I do know this.

1457
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,422
He'll do anything
to keep her from racing.

1458
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:43,958
Because if she crosses
the finish line,

1459
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,728
The game will reset and
she won't be a glitch anymore!

1460
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:48,029
Where is she now?

1461
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:49,364
In the fungeon
with fix-it felix.

1462
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:50,665
Felix?

1463
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:52,867
I'm sorry!
That's all I know, I swear!

1464
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:56,037
Now, please, don't put me back
in your filthy mouth again!

1465
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:57,438
(sobbing)

1466
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:00,441
Stick around.

1467
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:02,944
Yes, okay, I will. I will.
Thank you!

1468
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:09,117
Come on.
I know you're out there.

1469
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,718
(grunts angrily)

1470
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,653
Saccharine-saturated
nightmare!

1471
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:15,022
(beeping rapidly)

1472
01:13:15,024 --> 01:13:17,525
(gasps) but... Where?

1473
01:13:18,694 --> 01:13:19,527
(screaming)

1474
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:26,801
(screeching)

1475
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:39,547
Doomsday and armageddon just
had a baby and it is ugly!

1476
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,451
Hello? Hello?

1477
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:47,722
Somebody! Anybody!
Please let me out!

1478
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:52,160
What's he say?

1479
01:13:52,162 --> 01:13:53,461
(imitating ralph)
I'm gonna wreck it!

1480
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:57,865
(groans)

1481
01:13:57,867 --> 01:14:00,768
Why do I fix
everything I touch?

1482
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:01,969
Oh! (sobs)

1483
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:03,571
Bam!

1484
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,607
Felix!
Ralph!

1485
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:09,177
I'm so glad to see you!

1486
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:12,914
Wait. No, I'm not. What do
you have to say for yourself!

1487
01:14:12,916 --> 01:14:15,683
Wait! I don't want to hear it.
I'm not talking to you!

1488
01:14:15,685 --> 01:14:17,852
Okay, don't talk. That's fine.

1489
01:14:17,854 --> 01:14:19,821
But you have to fix
this go-cart for me pronto.

1490
01:14:19,823 --> 01:14:22,924
I don't have to do boo!
Forgive my potty mouth.

1491
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:26,594
I'm just so,
so cross with you!

1492
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:28,830
Do you have any idea
what you put me through?

1493
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:31,933
I ran higgledy-piggledy all
over creation looking for you.

1494
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:34,235
I almost drowned
in chocolate milk-mix!

1495
01:14:34,237 --> 01:14:38,639
And then... I met
the most dynamite gal.

1496
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:41,075
Oh! She gives me the honey
glow something awful.

1497
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:44,812
But she rebuffed
my affections.

1498
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,081
And then I got thrown in jail!

1499
01:14:47,083 --> 01:14:49,650
Felix, pull yourself together.

1500
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:52,753
No! You don't know what
it's like to be rejected

1501
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:54,655
And treated like a criminal!

1502
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:56,791
Yes, I do.
That's every day of my life.

1503
01:14:57,926 --> 01:14:59,827
It is?

1504
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:03,564
Which is why I ran off
and tried to be a good guy,
but I'm not!

1505
01:15:03,566 --> 01:15:06,667
I'm just a bad guy,
and I need your help.

1506
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:08,569
There's a little girl
whose only hope is this cart.

1507
01:15:08,571 --> 01:15:11,172
Please, felix, fix it.

1508
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:13,841
And I promise I will never try
to be good again.

1509
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:26,821
(loud thud)
huh?

1510
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,700
I know, I know, I'm an idiot.

1511
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:42,837
And?
And a real numskull.

1512
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:46,674
And?
A selfish diaper baby.

1513
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:47,708
And?

1514
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,844
And...

1515
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:52,046
A stinkbrain?

1516
01:15:52,048 --> 01:15:54,615
The stinkiest brain ever.

1517
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:59,954
(fanfare)

1518
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:06,961
(cheering)

1519
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:13,601
(engine revving)

1520
01:16:17,773 --> 01:16:19,941
King candy: (over pa)
<i>my sweet subjects,</i>

1521
01:16:19,943 --> 01:16:23,277
<i>I can without a pinch</i>
<i>of hesitation assure you</i>

1522
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:25,980
<i>That I have never been</i>
<i>so happy in all my life</i>

1523
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:28,849
<i>To say the following wor,</i>

1524
01:16:28,851 --> 01:16:31,852
<i>Let the random roster race</i>
<i>commence!</i>

1525
01:16:31,854 --> 01:16:32,920
(laughs excitedly)

1526
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,857
(tires squealing)

1527
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:43,931
(cars whooshing)

1528
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:52,607
Okay, remember,
you don't have to win.

1529
01:16:52,609 --> 01:16:54,375
Just cross that finish line,
and you'll be a real racer.

1530
01:16:54,377 --> 01:16:56,177
I'm already a real racer.

1531
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,114
And I'm going to win.

1532
01:17:00,116 --> 01:17:01,649
(engine roaring)

1533
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:04,318
(beeping)

1534
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:26,040
Announcer over pa:
<i>Power up!</i>

1535
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:32,079
Whoa!
(screams)

1536
01:17:33,281 --> 01:17:34,815
<i>Oh! A la mode!</i>

1537
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:35,416
(cheering)

1538
01:17:39,821 --> 01:17:41,822
<i>Sweet seekers!</i>

1539
01:17:41,824 --> 01:17:43,057
Have some candy.

1540
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:50,698
(laughs)

1541
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:02,810
Behind you!

1542
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:04,879
In front of you!

1543
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:13,287
Huh?

1544
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:16,157
It's the glitch!
The glitch?

1545
01:18:16,159 --> 01:18:17,158
Light them up, candlehead.

1546
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:19,026
(laughs)

1547
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:24,231
Announcer:
<i>What's this? Cherry bombs!</i>

1548
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:25,099
(gasps)

1549
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,974
I told you. You're just
an accident waiting to happen.

1550
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:39,780
(racers laughing)

1551
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:43,884
(all screaming)

1552
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:48,222
(vanellope grunting)

1553
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:52,026
(sobbing)

1554
01:18:52,028 --> 01:18:54,462
My candle!

1555
01:18:54,464 --> 01:18:57,164
All right.
Gotta keep it under control.

1556
01:18:57,166 --> 01:18:58,032
No more glitching.

1557
01:19:00,235 --> 01:19:02,269
Okay, kid.
Let's finish this thing

1558
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:03,237
Without any more surprises.
Oh!

1559
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:05,306
Ow!

1560
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:07,274
Hope you're happy,
junkpile.

1561
01:19:07,276 --> 01:19:09,477
This game is going down,
and it's all your fault.

1562
01:19:09,479 --> 01:19:11,345
My lady, you came back.

1563
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:13,047
Can it, fix-it!

1564
01:19:13,049 --> 01:19:16,050
That cy-bug you brought
with you multiplied.

1565
01:19:16,052 --> 01:19:17,818
No. It died in the taffy
swamp. Believe me, I...

1566
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:21,422
(crowd screaming)

1567
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:22,923
Bullroar.

1568
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:24,792
(gun powering up)

1569
01:19:30,866 --> 01:19:34,201
Listen up, people. Head to
game central station now!

1570
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:36,003
Move it! Let's go! Let's go!

1571
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:37,872
Go! Go! Go!

1572
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:46,380
No!

1573
01:20:20,315 --> 01:20:21,482
(whooping)

1574
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:27,188
Huh?

1575
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:30,391
Get off of my track!

1576
01:20:30,393 --> 01:20:31,258
Hey!

1577
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:34,295
Vanellope: What,
are you crazy!

1578
01:20:34,297 --> 01:20:39,233
I forbid you to cross
that finish line!

1579
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:41,268
Knock it off!

1580
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:45,940
Felix: Ralph, look!

1581
01:20:46,575 --> 01:20:47,608
Ralph: Kid!

1582
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:51,145
Stop it!

1583
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:55,282
I'm not letting you undo
all my hard work!

1584
01:20:55,284 --> 01:20:56,250
(both grunting)

1585
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:58,452
Is that...

1586
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:02,523
No way!

1587
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:06,894
What the...
Who are you?

1588
01:21:06,896 --> 01:21:10,865
I'm turbo,
the greatest racer ever!

1589
01:21:10,867 --> 01:21:13,934
And I did not reprogram
this world to let you

1590
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:16,537
And that
halitosis-riddled warthog

1591
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:18,339
Take it away from me!

1592
01:21:18,341 --> 01:21:19,640
(engine revving)

1593
01:21:19,642 --> 01:21:21,041
Turbo-tastic.

1594
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,643
(laughs evilly)

1595
01:21:22,645 --> 01:21:24,645
End of the line, glitch!

1596
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:27,047
(gasps) glitch. That's it.

1597
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,184
Come on, vanellope.

1598
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:31,585
I know you said
you wouldn't do it again

1599
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:33,888
But you're going to do it
one more time.

1600
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,923
Just focus and concentrate

1601
01:21:35,925 --> 01:21:38,659
And glitch!

1602
01:21:40,195 --> 01:21:40,928
(shrieks in surprise)

1603
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:44,431
(laughs triumphantly)

1604
01:21:44,433 --> 01:21:46,033
Sweet mother of monkey milk!
I did it!

1605
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,069
No!

1606
01:21:50,972 --> 01:21:51,672
(screams)

1607
01:21:56,077 --> 01:21:58,479
Bring it home, kid!
The finish line is wide open!

1608
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:08,956
(vanellope grunts)

1609
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:14,328
No!

1610
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:18,332
Kid! Are you okay?

1611
01:22:18,334 --> 01:22:21,201
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Let's finish this race!

1612
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:26,273
Oh, my land.

1613
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,708
All right. Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1614
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:28,509
But I didn't cross
the finish line!

1615
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:32,513
Ralph: There is
no finish line!

1616
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:34,448
Move it or lose it, people.
Everybody, out. Now!

1617
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:39,086
Ralph, it's not going to work!

1618
01:22:39,088 --> 01:22:39,987
We got to try!

1619
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:44,391
Kid!

1620
01:22:44,393 --> 01:22:45,960
Ralph, I told you
I can't leave the game.

1621
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:49,363
Come on. Get through.
Ralph! Stop!

1622
01:22:49,365 --> 01:22:52,132
It's got to work!

1623
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:54,335
Stop, it's no use.

1624
01:22:54,337 --> 01:22:56,136
(ralph panting)

1625
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:03,377
It's okay, ralph.

1626
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,448
Sergeant calhoun:
All right, fix-it.

1627
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:09,516
That's everyone. Now, we've
got to blow up this exit.

1628
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:14,154
Just go. Go without me.

1629
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:18,759
But what about this game?
Nothing we can do about it.

1630
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:21,495
Without a beacon, there's
no way to stop these monsters.

1631
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:26,033
Beacon?

1632
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:29,370
Stay with felix.

1633
01:23:29,372 --> 01:23:31,038
Let me borrow
that thing, lady.

1634
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:33,374
Ralph! Where are you going?
I got some wrecking to do!

1635
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:35,576
I'll meet you
at the finish line!

1636
01:23:35,578 --> 01:23:36,777
No! Wait!

1637
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:38,045
Fix-it, get behind me!

1638
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:44,685
(grunts)

1639
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:46,286
(yelling)

1640
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:49,189
(rumbling)

1641
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:54,128
Come on!

1642
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,334
One more! One...

1643
01:24:01,136 --> 01:24:02,403
Oh!

1644
01:24:02,405 --> 01:24:04,805
Welcome to the boss level!

1645
01:24:04,807 --> 01:24:06,774
Turbo.

1646
01:24:06,776 --> 01:24:09,643
(laughs maniacally)
because of you, ralph,

1647
01:24:09,645 --> 01:24:14,481
I'm now the most powerful
virus in the arcade!

1648
01:24:14,483 --> 01:24:16,250
I can take over
any game I want.

1649
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:18,185
I should thank you

1650
01:24:18,187 --> 01:24:19,753
But it would be more fun
to kill you.

1651
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:24,425
Get back here, little guy!

1652
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:31,598
Have some candy!

1653
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:34,768
Where do you think
you're going?

1654
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:42,476
I'm not through with you yet.
Up we go!

1655
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:43,777
No!

1656
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:46,480
Ralph!

1657
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:52,152
Fall back.

1658
01:24:52,154 --> 01:24:53,253
(ralph grunting)

1659
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:54,621
Kid!

1660
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:02,362
Vanellope!

1661
01:25:02,364 --> 01:25:05,466
Oh, look at that.
It's your little friend.

1662
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:08,202
Let's watch her die together,
shall we?

1663
01:25:08,204 --> 01:25:09,570
Ralph: No!

1664
01:25:09,572 --> 01:25:11,772
(king candy laughs)

1665
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:13,807
It's game over
for both of you.

1666
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:17,344
No. Just for me!

1667
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:21,248
(gasps) ralph!
Vanellope!

1668
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:29,823
I'm bad, and that's good.

1669
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,227
I will never be good,
and that's not bad.

1670
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:38,232
There's no one
I'd rather be...

1671
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:41,301
...Than me.

1672
01:25:43,771 --> 01:25:44,638
(loud thud)

1673
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:11,498
Kid!

1674
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,168
Don't worry.
I got it under control.

1675
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,362
You fools! Why are you
going into the ligh...

1676
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:43,330
(chuckles)

1677
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:47,601
No! No, no, no. Yes...

1678
01:26:47,603 --> 01:26:50,337
No! Yes... No!

1679
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:53,640
Go into the light!

1680
01:26:58,279 --> 01:26:58,912
Ralph: Whoa!

1681
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:02,516
Chocolate?

1682
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:04,418
(ralph laughs)

1683
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:06,820
It's chocolate!
I love chocolate!

1684
01:27:06,822 --> 01:27:09,456
(whooping)
oh, beautiful chocolate!

1685
01:27:09,458 --> 01:27:10,224
Vanellope: Yeah!

1686
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:14,828
You did it, ralph!
Oh, way to go, brother!

1687
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:15,862
(laughing)

1688
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:18,599
(gasps)

1689
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:22,469
I... Excuse...

1690
01:27:29,477 --> 01:27:31,778
All fixed.

1691
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:34,281
You ready for this?
As ready as I'll ever be.

1692
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:42,656
Whoa!

1693
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:45,692
What's with
all the magic sparkles?

1694
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:09,049
(cheering)

1695
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:16,623
Princess vanellope?

1696
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:18,392
Now I remember.

1697
01:28:19,994 --> 01:28:24,298
All hail the rightful ruler of
<i>sugar rush...</i>

1698
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,866
Princess vanellope.

1699
01:28:25,868 --> 01:28:27,567
(gasps)

1700
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:28,769
I remember.
She's our princess!

1701
01:28:28,771 --> 01:28:30,704
Oh, that's right!

1702
01:28:30,706 --> 01:28:32,306
We are so sorry
about the way we treated you.

1703
01:28:32,308 --> 01:28:34,474
Yeah, those were jokes!

1704
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:36,343
(whining) I was just doing
what taffyta told me to do!

1705
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,012
Tut-tut.

1706
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:42,816
As your merciful princess,
I hereby decree

1707
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:46,486
That everyone who was ever
mean to me shall be

1708
01:28:46,954 --> 01:28:48,388
Executed.

1709
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:50,724
What? No, please!

1710
01:28:50,726 --> 01:28:52,592
Oh, my land.

1711
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:54,861
Oh! This place
just got interesting.

1712
01:28:54,863 --> 01:28:57,364
(sobbing)
I don't want to die!

1713
01:28:57,366 --> 01:29:00,767
I'm just kidding.
Stop crying, taffyta.

1714
01:29:00,769 --> 01:29:02,336
I'm trying, but it won't stop.

1715
01:29:03,738 --> 01:29:05,605
Wow.

1716
01:29:05,607 --> 01:29:08,942
So this is the real you.
Princess.

1717
01:29:08,944 --> 01:29:12,346
Aw, ralph, what are you, nuts?
Come on. This isn't me.

1718
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:16,116
This is me.

1719
01:29:16,118 --> 01:29:17,951
Huh?

1720
01:29:17,953 --> 01:29:19,720
Look, the code may say
I'm a princess

1721
01:29:19,722 --> 01:29:21,621
But I know who
I really am, ralph,

1722
01:29:21,623 --> 01:29:24,491
I'm a racer with
the greatest superpower ever.

1723
01:29:24,493 --> 01:29:26,360
I was here, I was there.

1724
01:29:26,362 --> 01:29:27,928
I was glitching
through the walls.

1725
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:29,096
I'm not giving that up.

1726
01:29:29,098 --> 01:29:31,598
Um, pardon me for asking,

1727
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:34,568
But without a princess,
who's going to lead us?

1728
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:36,436
Yeah. Who?

1729
01:29:36,438 --> 01:29:39,740
Uh, me. I'm thinking
more along the lines of

1730
01:29:39,742 --> 01:29:42,008
A constitutional democracy.

1731
01:29:42,010 --> 01:29:45,679
President
vanellope von schweetz.

1732
01:29:45,681 --> 01:29:46,813
Has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

1733
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:51,118
Fix-it, wreck-it,
the arcade's about to open.

1734
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,753
Let's move 'em out.

1735
01:30:00,661 --> 01:30:03,563
You could just stay here
and live in the castle.

1736
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:05,031
You'd have your own wing

1737
01:30:05,033 --> 01:30:06,767
Where no one would ever
complain about your stench

1738
01:30:06,769 --> 01:30:08,802
Or treat you bad ever again.

1739
01:30:08,804 --> 01:30:10,437
You could be happy.

1740
01:30:11,439 --> 01:30:14,441
I'm already happy.

1741
01:30:14,443 --> 01:30:15,575
I've got the coolest friend
in the world.

1742
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:19,746
And besides,
I've got a job to do, too.

1743
01:30:19,748 --> 01:30:22,783
It may not be as fancy
as being president

1744
01:30:22,785 --> 01:30:24,451
But it's my duty.

1745
01:30:24,453 --> 01:30:26,052
And it's a big duty!

1746
01:30:26,054 --> 01:30:27,954
(chuckles)

1747
01:30:27,956 --> 01:30:28,822
Ralph, are you coming,
brother?

1748
01:30:30,758 --> 01:30:33,760
See you later,
president fart feathers.

1749
01:30:33,762 --> 01:30:37,030
<i>Au revoir,</i>
<i>admiral underpants.</i>

1750
01:30:37,032 --> 01:30:39,900
And farewell,
baroness boogerface.

1751
01:30:39,902 --> 01:30:42,702
Goodbye, major body odor!

1752
01:30:42,704 --> 01:30:45,005
<i>Hasta la vista</i>you...
Ralph!

1753
01:30:45,007 --> 01:30:46,873
All right. To be continued.
Yeah!

1754
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:48,141
All: Hooray!

1755
01:31:01,589 --> 01:31:02,823
Ralph:  <i>I'm gonna wreck it!</i>

1756
01:31:02,825 --> 01:31:04,791
(grunting angrily)

1757
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:08,128
Hey! Ralph's back!
Isn't that great!

1758
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:10,664
(laughs excitedly)
the gang's all here!

1759
01:31:10,666 --> 01:31:14,868
So, I'm happy to report,
and you'll be happy to hear,

1760
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:16,636
I'm taking life
one game at a time.

1761
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:19,172
All right! Yeah, ralph!

1762
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:20,040
Ralph:  <i>Of course,</i>
<i>the job hasn't changed.</i>

1763
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,810
<i>But, news flash,</i>

1764
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:26,646
<i>The nicelanders</i>
<i>are being nice to me!</i>

1765
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:28,648
<i>And that got me thinking abot</i>
<i>those poor guys left</i>
