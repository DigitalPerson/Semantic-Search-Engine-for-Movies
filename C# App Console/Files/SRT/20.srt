1
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,734
Dispatch?
<i>Go ahead, 26.</i>

2
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:58,300
Yeah. Contact the FAA.

3
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:02,696
Tell them some smart-ass is flying a jet plane
around out here with no lights on.

4
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:05,226
<i>Roger that.</i>

5
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:13,970
Did I hear you ain't comin' to the game?

6
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:17,374
Somethin' about "you don't want to
drive five hours to see a football game?"

7
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:19,625
Well, I'm not a big croud guy.

8
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:23,305
Plus, someone has to stay behind,
to keep the peace.

9
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:31,288
- You going boating?
- I'm undercover.

10
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:34,757
Sure, Ray.
You blend right in.

11
00:03:34,758 --> 00:03:38,638
- See you Sunday.
- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about your car?

12
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,612
It's parked in a fire zone.

13
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:44,128
If there's a fire...

14
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:48,260
go ahead and move it.
But please, be careful with her.

15
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:54,296
Schmuck.

16
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:57,466
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning.

17
00:03:57,467 --> 00:03:59,066
- Morning.
- Hey, Sheriff.

18
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:01,143
- What a beautiful day.
- Yes, it sure is.

19
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:02,961
- Hey, Ray!
- Hey.

20
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:05,285
I almost didn't recognize you in plain clothes.

21
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:09,033
Well, it's my day off.
Should be a quiet weekend.

22
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,303
- No more of those big omelets, OK?
- All right boss. But you know you like 'em.

23
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:16,545
Oh, yeah, but ...

24
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:19,194
Thanks.

25
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,823
<i>- It doesn't matter.</i>
<i>- It does!</i>

26
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:40,918
Howdy fellas.

27
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,290
- Hey.
- Howdy Sheriff.

28
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:48,267
I'm guessing that's your rig out front.
What are you guys hauling today?

29
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:51,204
- Auto parts.
- Yeah.

30
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:55,130
- Gotta hit New Orleans by noon tomorrow.
- Oh, that's a long drive.

31
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:57,137
- Sure is.
- Yep.

32
00:04:57,231 --> 00:04:59,137
Check please.

33
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,798
- Keep the change.
- Thanks!

34
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:09,893
- We're 'bout to hit the road.
- Well, drive safely.

35
00:05:10,722 --> 00:05:13,136
Sure will.

36
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:20,181
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, boys.

37
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:26,460
Boy, you sure are bad for business.
Did you want somethin' to eat?

38
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:30,575
- Sheriff?
- No. No thanks, Christie.

39
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:32,873
I'd better get going.

40
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,137
Bye.

41
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,933
- See ya' later, Ray.
- See you.

42
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,730
<i>... that's the Arizona State Fair,
where Grand Avenue and W. McDowell Road...</i>

43
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:58,945
That'll put another asshole
in the elephant right there boys.

44
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:03,788
My turn, come on.

45
00:06:04,017 --> 00:06:06,880
Wait! Now watch that kick.
She don't know it's your first time.

46
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:10,075
- Just hand it over. Stand back.
- All right, all right. Here we go.

47
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:25,383
- What the Fuck?!
- No, no, no.

48
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,127
Easy! Easy!

49
00:06:32,862 --> 00:06:36,306
- Hey, I warned you.
- Let me see. Let me see.

50
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,746
What? What?

51
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:40,408
Shit!

52
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:44,152
- Is it broken? Do you think that it's broken?
- It should be.

53
00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:45,421
- Is it broke...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

54
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:47,979
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

55
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:53,614
I thought he wasn't working today.

56
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:57,185
What's up, Ray?

57
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,757
Hey, Ray. How you doin' man?
Good to see you.

58
00:07:00,758 --> 00:07:03,980
Can someone tell me
what two-thirds of my force is doing out here

59
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:07,054
firing rockets at a slab of beef?

60
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:09,469
Afternoon, Ray.

61
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:18,247
- Do you have a permit for that monster?
- Yeah, right here.

62
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:24,141
Why don't you get him a towel or something?
He's messing up his uniform. And you,

63
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:27,375
- clean the chunk of beef off your hat.
- I gotta' chunk of beef?

64
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:31,218
Oh, look at that. That's nasty.
Thank you.

65
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:37,777
There you go.

66
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:41,470
The Dinkum Firearm and Historic Weapons Museum?

67
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:45,049
- That's right.
- You got a museum here?

68
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,782
And the tax returns to prove it.

69
00:07:46,783 --> 00:07:50,472
Open every second Thursday of the month,
noon 'til three, bring the whole family.

70
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:56,530
Sorry.

71
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,502
- There you go.
- Thank you.

72
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:02,838
Ray, I'm really sorry.

73
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,840
Ray? We were just havin' a little fun.

74
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:09,144
Not much to do in town,
it's pretty dead over there, and uh...

75
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:11,312
you know, we needed somethin' to do.

76
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:12,514
- Really?
- Yeah.

77
00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:14,515
- Well, I've got something for you.
- Okay.

78
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:16,951
A couple of truckers stopped in town.

79
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:20,455
They weren't too happy to see me.
There's something off about them.

80
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:22,956
Run those plates for me.

81
00:08:23,423 --> 00:08:25,226
Mine, Sheriff.

82
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:28,195
If you get a hit, pass it on to the troopers.

83
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:31,764
Wow! You're lookin' jacked, Ray.
You been workin' out?

84
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:39,473
- I warned him about the recoil.
- Give me the damned thing.

85
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:41,475
Let me have a go.

86
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:45,878
Before I change my mind,
and write you a citation.

87
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:06,800
We've secured the location.

88
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:08,867
Okay, are we all ready?

89
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:10,949
- Game on, boss.
- Love it.

90
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,013
Yeah, boss?

91
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:16,552
We've got some trouble with the farmer.

92
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:24,027
What? Can't handle one farmer?

93
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:31,651
Tell you what...
Let's get started!

94
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:37,845
I'll talk to him.

95
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:41,618
I'm great when it comes to farmers.

96
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:58,847
Howdy.
How's it goin'?

97
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:03,717
Things be goin' a lot better if you tell me
what the hell you doin' on my property.

98
00:10:04,556 --> 00:10:06,809
My name is Burrel.

99
00:10:10,384 --> 00:10:15,675
You see, I'm shooting a commercial,
I'm sure you've seen one on TV...

100
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:18,933
and your property...

101
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,689
- would be just perfect...
- Hey!

102
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,109
Get the hell off my property.

103
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:29,915
The company I'm workin' for,
gonna pay you a lot of money.

104
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:34,460
- You don't have to do a damn...
- Did you hear what I said? Huh?

105
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:43,265
Don't you at least want to hear
what I have to offer?

106
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:47,988
No. Do you want to hear my offer?

107
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:54,236
You clear out now,
and I won't fill your ass full of buckshot.

108
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:59,737
Old man, you better put that piece away,
before you blow your toes off.

109
00:10:59,738 --> 00:11:03,049
We just talkin' here.

110
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:08,583
Now we finished talkin'.
You get out the hell out of here!

111
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:12,646
Okay.

112
00:11:15,365 --> 00:11:17,000
That's your decision.

113
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:21,578
You don't want to take the silver?

114
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:25,297
Better take the lead.

115
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,558
What I'm trying to say is...

116
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,177
It's embarassing to have to
lock up your ex-boyfriend.

117
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:39,116
- Who's fault is that?
- The person who stole. You.

118
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:41,846
I mean, who's fault is it we're exes?

119
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:44,508
- We are not talking about that right now.
- Oh yes, we are.

120
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:48,702
I mean, we're talking about something else,
but we're really talking about that.

121
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:51,010
Do you have an aspirin?

122
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,671
This isn't the nurses office.

123
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,461
- I mean, what is wrong with you?
- Oh my God.

124
00:11:56,462 --> 00:12:01,364
You had everything. You were smart,
you were popular, you were a great athlete.

125
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:03,052
I mean hell,
you had a full ride through college.

126
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:06,045
Had you not gotten yourself
kicked off the track team.

127
00:12:06,046 --> 00:12:07,323
You really want to do this?

128
00:12:07,324 --> 00:12:09,775
Ok, I served my country in
fucking Iraq and Afghanistan.

129
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:11,723
No, we're not talking about the war, OK.

130
00:12:11,724 --> 00:12:14,422
We're talking about your being locked up
for being drunk and disorderly.

131
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:17,552
What do you care if we're not together?

132
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:19,794
Hey, Sarah.

133
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:23,055
- What's up, Frank?
- What's up, buddy?

134
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:29,748
That was awkward.

135
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:33,338
Hey, are you two dating again?

136
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:34,929
- Maybe.
- No.

137
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,966
Do we really have to keep him locked up in here?

138
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:38,992
Yes!

139
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,544
Why?

140
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:45,183
Because the boss say I gotta' keep you
locked up for the weekend. That's why.

141
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,683
Could you show me how to run these plates?

142
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:00,997
Idiot! Give me that.

143
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,562
- I'm just doing this once, okay?
- Oh, I know.

144
00:13:05,563 --> 00:13:07,464
Pay attention.

145
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,173
Hey, Ray.
Damn.

146
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:35,862
The plates on that truck checked out.
Nevada registry, The driver is one Burrel Thomas.

147
00:13:35,863 --> 00:13:37,475
Clean record.

148
00:13:37,476 --> 00:13:39,406
Great.

149
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:42,241
- Good work.
- Thanks.

150
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:52,817
But I'm sure you didn't come all
the way over here to just tell me that.

151
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:02,876
I need to make a move.

152
00:14:02,877 --> 00:14:06,361
Go some place where there's some action,
where I can make a difference.

153
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:07,973
Like when you worked Narcotics in L.A.,

154
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:12,070
I just don't understand how you ever
gave it up to come to this place.

155
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,275
The most exciting thing I've
done in the past four days is...

156
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:18,350
rescue a cat out of a tree.

157
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:20,775
Sommerton has its charms.

158
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,318
Maybe...

159
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,195
I've never been out of it,
and I'm going stir crazy here.

160
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,351
Do you think you could
help me get a job in L.A.?

161
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,509
L.A. is not all you think it is.

162
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:44,382
Look...

163
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:47,772
I understand that you want to move on.

164
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:51,034
You're young.
You want to experience adventure.

165
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:52,797
When I was your age,

166
00:14:52,798 --> 00:14:54,593
all I wanted to do was move to Los Angeles.

167
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:58,354
I wanted to be part of the action.
But now...

168
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,532
thinking back, I feel differently.

169
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:08,199
But if that's what you really want,
of course I'll help you.

170
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,262
Morning.

171
00:15:24,263 --> 00:15:27,548
Thank you for coming on such short notice
at such an early hour.

172
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:30,500
This is a top secret operation.

173
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,790
In 45 seconds, we'll move a prisoner

174
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,577
to Federal Death Row.

175
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,671
That prisoner is Gabriel Cortez.

176
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,884
Cortez is the most vicious cartel boss

177
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:43,021
since Pablo Escobar.

178
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:46,440
Let's make sure this guy never
sees the light of day again.

179
00:15:46,441 --> 00:15:49,110
We will travel underneath the radar.

180
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:03,175
Let's do this.

181
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:44,996
<i>Convoy is holding at position Alpha.</i>

182
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:47,126
<i>Awaiting clearance to proceed.</i>

183
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,012
<i>Be advised.</i>

184
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:10,787
Fuck! What the hell?

185
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:12,382
Jesus!

186
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:22,932
- Spread out!
- Cover me!

187
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,850
Hold your fire!

188
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:38,770
Fire!

189
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:46,388
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

190
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:49,713
On the roof! On the roof!
Move! Move, move, move!

191
00:17:57,147 --> 00:18:00,623
- John, I'll cover the alley.
- Good. Ok, you go with her.

192
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:08,514
HRT, you take the stairwells.
You two guys are comin' with me.

193
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:10,436
You shut down elevators.
The rest of you secure this place.

194
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,519
Nobody gets in or out.

195
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,026
- Ready.
- Let's do it.

196
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,063
Cover all flanks.
Move, move, move!

197
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,870
Pick it up, gentelman!
Pick it up!

198
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,493
Here.

199
00:18:58,843 --> 00:19:02,455
1167, What happened?
I need back-up and air support.

200
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,023
Medic!

201
00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:38,040
Let's go!

202
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,208
<i>HRT, report.</i>

203
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:43,445
We've got two agents down.
Cortez is gone.

204
00:20:08,962 --> 00:20:11,086
Stop! FBI!

205
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:13,642
Cut him off!
Cut him off!

206
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:21,160
Stop!

207
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:37,121
Show me your hands!
Don't fuckin' move!

208
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:45,626
It's not him.
It's not him.

209
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,303
Stop! FBI!

210
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:51,871
Son of a bitch!

211
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:03,503
McKay!

212
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:05,145
<i>Richards, what do you see, tell me.</i>

213
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:07,895
All quite in the rear entrance.

214
00:21:09,004 --> 00:21:11,251
We're checking the alley now.

215
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:30,193
John...

216
00:21:33,113 --> 00:21:35,998
<i>Richards. Richards.</i>

217
00:21:37,374 --> 00:21:41,559
<i>You copy?
Richards!</i>

218
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:44,079
Don't.

219
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:52,610
It's McKay, isn't it?

220
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:59,038
Baby on the way, right?

221
00:22:00,705 --> 00:22:04,284
Put the gun down.

222
00:22:09,331 --> 00:22:11,410
Richards! Richards?

223
00:22:16,507 --> 00:22:19,254
- Man down! Man down!
- I got it.

224
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,147
Shit.

225
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:30,224
- Yeah? Yeah?
- No.

226
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,839
I want you to shut down every private airfield

227
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,798
and landing strip in a hundred mile radius,

228
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:40,997
I don't care how small.

229
00:22:40,998 --> 00:22:42,835
- That's going to take some doing.
- Then get doing.

230
00:22:42,836 --> 00:22:45,656
You need to check every building
that has a camera facing the street,

231
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,899
I want you to check that and see if
you can get an ID or a license plate.

232
00:22:56,503 --> 00:22:58,842
How much did he pay you?

233
00:22:58,856 --> 00:23:02,221
<i>He asked how much you were paid.</i>

234
00:23:02,627 --> 00:23:04,981
<i>For what?</i>

235
00:23:04,982 --> 00:23:07,046
He doesn't know what you're talking about.

236
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:11,061
What, you think I'm an idiot?
Do I look like an idiot to you?

237
00:23:11,062 --> 00:23:12,916
Do you want me to ask him?

238
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:16,380
No. I want you to ask him why he's wearing that.
Why is he dressed that way?

239
00:23:16,381 --> 00:23:20,221
Why are you dressed like that?

240
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:23,956
<i>He's wondering why are you dressed like this.</i>

241
00:23:23,957 --> 00:23:27,449
<i>I wear the colors of the
Dutch National Team. Why?</i>

242
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,843
He says he supports the
National Dutch football team.

243
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:34,707
- What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
- The soccer team.

244
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:37,505
He's wearing their team colors.

245
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:40,611
You can't fuck with me, or what?

246
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:45,172
All right. I'll play this game.

247
00:23:45,764 --> 00:23:49,419
What country do Dutch people come from?

248
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,498
<i>He's an asshole,
he almost broke my hand.</i>

249
00:23:53,653 --> 00:23:56,985
He says his arm hurts from where you grabbed him.

250
00:23:56,986 --> 00:23:59,973
He was reaching for something,
I was worried for my life.

251
00:23:59,974 --> 00:24:03,382
So I tried to hit you.
I should have hit you the fuck harder.

252
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:05,467
That's such bullshit!

253
00:24:05,468 --> 00:24:08,521
Oh, so now you speak English?

254
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:13,100
If you knew any Spanish,
you'd know I was barely speaking it a minute ago.

255
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:15,063
All right, smart-ass.

256
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:17,449
What were you doing out at 4am?

257
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,275
It's Vegas, man!

258
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:29,265
Sir, we have something.

259
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:46,777
Owens here, what's up?

260
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:50,490
Hi, sheriff. It's Christie.
Did I wake you up?

261
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:51,988
No, no, no, no, no...

262
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:54,959
I was already busy.
What can I do for you?

263
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,014
Well, I just came in to open up the diner
and the milk hasn't been delivered yet.

264
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:04,114
Is this really a police matter?

265
00:25:04,115 --> 00:25:07,784
Mr. Parsons always delivers
fresh milk first thing.

266
00:25:07,785 --> 00:25:09,801
<i>He's a very early riser, you know.</i>

267
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:12,675
<i>I don't even care about the milk,
nobody's even around this weekend, but...</i>

268
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:16,567
<i>that man hasn't missed a delivery
ever since I can remember.</i>

269
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:18,314
<i>And I'm worried about him.</i>

270
00:25:18,315 --> 00:25:21,085
Well, have you ever thought about calling him?

271
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,282
<i>Stubborn ole bastard doesn't have a phone out there.</i>

272
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,253
Oh, that's right.

273
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:28,282
I forgot.

274
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:30,665
<i>I'm just afraid he's got
a heart attack or somethin'.</i>

275
00:25:30,666 --> 00:25:32,823
Sorry to wake you.

276
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:36,794
There's just nobody else around,
<i>and I didn't know who else to call.</i>

277
00:25:36,795 --> 00:25:39,192
No, you did the right thing, Christie.

278
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:43,069
I'm going to send a deputy out there and
I gonna have him check up on him, All right?

279
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,973
<i>- Thanks, Sheriff.</i>
- All right. Bye, bye.

280
00:25:48,478 --> 00:25:50,744
Cortez and his crew, they dumped the white sedan

281
00:25:50,745 --> 00:25:53,679
and they got into two separate cars.

282
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,384
And as of right now, we think,
that Cortez is in this one.

283
00:25:57,385 --> 00:25:59,600
Hold that right there.

284
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:04,648
What is that?

285
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:06,883
Where's Mitchell?
He ​​knows cars.

286
00:26:06,884 --> 00:26:09,163
Mitchell, come here.

287
00:26:09,164 --> 00:26:11,322
- Yes, sir?
- Blow that up.

288
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:14,635
Aaron, Aaron. What kind of car is this?

289
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,883
I think it's a "ZR1".

290
00:26:17,884 --> 00:26:21,060
- What the hell's a ZR1?
- The Corvette ZR1.

291
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:24,201
This one is a specially modified show car.

292
00:26:24,202 --> 00:26:25,979
It's a monster on wheels.

293
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,739
It was all over the news, like two days ago.

294
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,485
It got stolen from the L.A. auto show.

295
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:34,527
Normally something around 700 horsepower.
But this is upwards of 1,000.

296
00:26:34,921 --> 00:26:38,314
I got a psychopath in a Batmobile.

297
00:26:38,354 --> 00:26:40,476
How am I suppose to stop them?

298
00:26:40,477 --> 00:26:42,528
Blow it up?

299
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:45,575
What if there's a hostage inside?

300
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:51,992
All right.

301
00:26:51,993 --> 00:26:55,809
Let's get this out to everybody in intel.
This is the car we're looking for right here.

302
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:02,484
<i>The car that you are looking for is
a modified version of a Corvette ZR1.</i>

303
00:27:02,485 --> 00:27:04,370
Yeah, I'm looking at a picture now.

304
00:27:04,371 --> 00:27:06,995
I'll let you know when he reaches our position.

305
00:27:12,937 --> 00:27:14,338
Officer.

306
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:17,685
- License and registration?
- Yes, sir.

307
00:27:18,686 --> 00:27:20,744
Here's my license.

308
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:26,048
Registration.

309
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:02,218
All units, call it in!

310
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:57,311
Hey! Hey!
Hold on, cowboy.

311
00:28:57,312 --> 00:28:59,064
You don't sneak up on ole man Parsons.

312
00:28:59,065 --> 00:29:02,142
You know what he's like.

313
00:29:02,143 --> 00:29:03,331
Hey, Mr. Parsons!

314
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:06,396
It's Jerry Bailey.
We just cme by to check up on you.

315
00:29:06,397 --> 00:29:09,417
So please don't take any shots at us, OK?

316
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,127
Shit.

317
00:29:12,128 --> 00:29:14,289
- All right. Let's check around back.
- Yeah.

318
00:29:34,052 --> 00:29:37,832
Hamburglar. Want to try the door first?

319
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,358
Mr. Parsons?

320
00:29:49,946 --> 00:29:52,730
I check upstairs, you check the ground floor.

321
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,318
Cortez just blew through their checkpoint.

322
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:50,528
But all airfields are closed,
so he won't be flying out.

323
00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:53,430
I want a roadblock here.
Bullhead City. Nothing gets through.

324
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:56,025
What the hell is he tryin' to do?

325
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:57,981
Southbound on the 95.

326
00:30:57,982 --> 00:31:00,501
He thinks he's getting to Mexico,
but that's not gonna happen.

327
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:01,801
Why doesn't he take a chopper?

328
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:05,152
The ZR1 is faster than any chopper.

329
00:31:05,153 --> 00:31:06,939
It's more than that.

330
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,868
Cortez, he's third-generation cartel boss.

331
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:13,799
He thinks he's untouchable.
That's how his mind works.

332
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,819
He wants to be behind the wheel.
Literally.

333
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,845
What do you mean?

334
00:31:17,846 --> 00:31:20,504
Cortez has been racing cars
since he was a teenager.

335
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:23,096
His father build him his own track in Sinaloa.

336
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:26,600
He's been racing on the pro circuit
in South America under a pseudonym.

337
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:28,005
I saw him drive.

338
00:31:28,006 --> 00:31:29,757
He's good.

339
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:37,493
Quiet!

340
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:39,772
Quiet!

341
00:31:41,287 --> 00:31:43,223
Bannister.

342
00:31:43,224 --> 00:31:45,336
<i>Are you having a nice day?</i>

343
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,681
It's gonna be.

344
00:31:46,682 --> 00:31:49,281
This can only end one of two ways.
And you know what?

345
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,773
I'm fine with either one of them.

346
00:31:50,774 --> 00:31:53,744
<i>With your pretty little
agent dead or alive?</i>

347
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,426
<i>I can cut her up in a hundred pieces,
and mail them back to you</i>

348
00:31:56,427 --> 00:31:59,382
<i>one by one. Is that what you want?</i>

349
00:31:59,383 --> 00:32:02,027
You've already killed one federal agent, Gabriel.

350
00:32:02,028 --> 00:32:03,896
You kill one another, and I guarentee you

351
00:32:03,897 --> 00:32:05,792
this world is not big enough for you to hide in.

352
00:32:05,793 --> 00:32:07,789
<i>How are you going to explain to her parents</i>

353
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:12,479
<i>why their daughter is
returning home in plastic bags.</i>

354
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:15,597
<i>Here's how it's gonna go, John.</i>

355
00:32:15,598 --> 00:32:19,013
<i>Pull your men back and
stay the fuck out of my way</i>

356
00:32:19,014 --> 00:32:21,148
<i>or your agent is rood kill.</i>

357
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,779
<i>I'm good either way.</i>

358
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,915
So let me talk to her.

359
00:32:27,247 --> 00:32:29,041
<i>I'm sorry, John.</i>

360
00:32:29,042 --> 00:32:32,824
<i>I really screwed this up, I'm so sorry.</i>

361
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,861
I'm gonna get you out of this.

362
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:36,742
All right. Don't worry.

363
00:32:36,743 --> 00:32:37,980
<i>I'm gonna get you out of this.</i>

364
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:42,510
If you try to stop me, a lot of people
that don't have to are going to die.

365
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:44,579
<i>It's your choce how to play this.</i>

366
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,255
Right now I'm just a guy out for a nice drive.

367
00:32:53,548 --> 00:32:55,164
So much for blowing him up.

368
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:57,590
Shut the fuck up!

369
00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:03,639
Yeah?

370
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,172
<i>Ray, we're here at Parsons.</i>

371
00:33:06,173 --> 00:33:10,733
<i>We found his body.
He's been ​​murdered.</i>

372
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:27,251
We got a positive ID. A cyber-grey
metallic ZR1 headed southbound on US 95.

373
00:33:29,272 --> 00:33:32,177
Hostage is visible inside the vehicle.

374
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:35,942
He's almost on you, chief.
<i>Copy that.</i>

375
00:33:35,943 --> 00:33:38,395
Don't worry.
We're ready for this guy.

376
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:41,882
<i>A lot of people have said that.
Cortez has a way of proving them wrong.</i>

377
00:33:41,883 --> 00:33:44,040
<i>I need you to be alert.</i>

378
00:33:44,282 --> 00:33:47,645
And you need to remind your men that
there's a hostage in that vehicle.

379
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,391
Coming up on the Arizona border.

380
00:33:50,392 --> 00:33:52,994
- He'll be on top of you soon.
- Copy that.

381
00:33:52,995 --> 00:33:55,269
<i>Everything's in place.</i>

382
00:33:59,201 --> 00:34:01,676
Five minutes.
Move.

383
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:11,637
Get comfy.
I want you to have a good view of the show.

384
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:13,140
What?

385
00:35:01,858 --> 00:35:04,139
Fall back!

386
00:35:05,882 --> 00:35:08,630
Fall back!

387
00:35:52,106 --> 00:35:54,094
Good God.

388
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,542
The barricades' been completely destroyed.

389
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:03,195
<i>It looks like a war zone down there.</i>

390
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:06,658
<i>We've got several officers down.</i>

391
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:11,468
I'm on my way.

392
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:17,201
Now remember, this is a crime scene.
Don't touch anything.

393
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:20,304
10-4 on that.

394
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:29,112
Ok, so the way I see it, we got a busted window.

395
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:32,230
All right, it looks like
a burglary gone bad to me.

396
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:37,049
I think what Parsons did,
he came in, and he surprized them maybe.

397
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:39,070
It coulda been that.

398
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:43,156
Did anyone check for tire tracks yet?

399
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:45,759
They were here first.

400
00:36:47,283 --> 00:36:48,873
I'll go check.

401
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,366
- Stay together.
- Yes, sir.

402
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:54,707
Show me the body.

403
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,655
Right over here.

404
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:01,966
Oh, Jesus.

405
00:37:11,035 --> 00:37:14,409
No burn mark on the entry wound.

406
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,274
The bullet passed clean through.

407
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:26,235
A pistol round didn't do this.

408
00:37:31,706 --> 00:37:34,346
Can you tell which way they went?

409
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:36,146
Towards the canyon.

410
00:37:36,147 --> 00:37:38,130
Let's go.

411
00:37:49,256 --> 00:37:54,496
Three million dollars in
Swiss accounts per our agreement.

412
00:37:55,101 --> 00:38:01,072
You know, in my country, the police
say "Gracias" after being paid off.

413
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:08,046
If you're going to continue
driving like a maniac,

414
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:11,529
Can I stop playing hostage now?

415
00:38:16,983 --> 00:38:18,535
Sorry.

416
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:33,197
What is that?

417
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:35,597
Excitement.

418
00:38:35,598 --> 00:38:37,289
What?

419
00:38:40,758 --> 00:38:43,636
<i>Shit. Just lost visual</i>
<i>We just lost visual.</i>

420
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:47,706
- How? How? Get it back.
- We're goin' around.

421
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:20,787
He's gone.

422
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:23,269
What do you mean he's gone?
Just keep looking.

423
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,544
You gotta keep looking. Keep looking!
Find him!

424
00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:31,236
We lost him.
We'll stay on it.

425
00:39:31,237 --> 00:39:33,236
Fuck!

426
00:39:49,977 --> 00:39:54,866
He was killed outside.
His body was moved inside after the fact.

427
00:39:57,007 --> 00:39:58,727
How quickly can Cortez make the border?

428
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:02,476
At the speed he's going,
65-75 minutes.

429
00:40:02,477 --> 00:40:06,576
That little patch of border he's
headed towards is mostly deep canyon.

430
00:40:06,577 --> 00:40:09,258
Can you bring that up for me, please?

431
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:12,990
The only crossing point is here.
Los Algodones.

432
00:40:12,991 --> 00:40:14,812
I know the CBP agent in charge down there.

433
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:16,076
He's a hard ass.

434
00:40:16,077 --> 00:40:18,556
And the border crossing was just rebuilt last year.

435
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:22,794
Concrete blast walls, in-ground retrackable steel barriers.

436
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,002
It's a fortress.

437
00:40:24,003 --> 00:40:26,982
Cortez isn't racing towards a target
without a strategy to get through.

438
00:40:26,983 --> 00:40:29,056
So whatever he's planning,
we've got to be ready for.

439
00:40:29,057 --> 00:40:32,572
Start moving assets to Algodones.
Reinforce that crossing, all right?

440
00:40:32,573 --> 00:40:36,635
What about this town?
Sommerton Junction.

441
00:40:36,636 --> 00:40:41,951
There's no official crossing,
but it's the closest point in his path.

442
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:43,889
Hang on.

443
00:40:44,796 --> 00:40:48,473
The ravine is too deep to cross.
It's a long shot.

444
00:40:48,474 --> 00:40:50,979
Let's not ignore it though.

445
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:55,420
I'll give the Sheriff a call.
Tell him to keep out of the way.

446
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:00,297
- Yep?
<i>- Sheriff Owens?</i>

447
00:41:00,298 --> 00:41:02,347
That's me.
Who am I talking to?

448
00:41:02,348 --> 00:41:04,535
John Bannister with the FBI.
We have a situation.

449
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:05,536
Well, talk to me.

450
00:41:05,537 --> 00:41:08,584
I have a violent fugitive making
a run for the Mexican border.

451
00:41:08,585 --> 00:41:11,596
Now there's a small chance that he
might try to cross at Sommerton.

452
00:41:11,597 --> 00:41:13,425
It's unlikely that he'll be comin' your way,

453
00:41:13,426 --> 00:41:16,181
but I'm going to send over a
SWAT team from El Centro just in case.

454
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,407
No offense, but I want them handling this.

455
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:21,066
<i>Listen, I can't talk right now.</i>
<i>I've got to go.</i>

456
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:25,979
What's up?

457
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:28,582
I don't know.

458
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:33,171
The FBI says there's an escaped fugitive
that might be heading our way.

459
00:41:33,172 --> 00:41:37,302
Shit, when it rains, it pours.

460
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:40,682
This is no coincidence.

461
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:44,538
First the guys at the diner, now this.

462
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:46,886
It's all connected.

463
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:50,056
I've got to reach Bailey and Torrance.

464
00:41:57,372 --> 00:42:00,087
Shit.

465
00:42:00,823 --> 00:42:03,369
What's that light over there?

466
00:42:03,514 --> 00:42:05,048
Do you think it's them?

467
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:08,246
Do you think the killer's
stupid enough to hang around here?

468
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:12,590
Damn it. Give me the Glock.

469
00:42:13,651 --> 00:42:16,262
Stop the car.
Stop the car.

470
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,515
What the hell is that?

471
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:29,315
<i>Bailey, Torrance, where are you?</i>

472
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:34,808
We followed some tire tracks to the
canyon edge at the south side of town.

473
00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:36,219
There's someone out here.

474
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,561
We're checking it out on foot.

475
00:42:37,562 --> 00:42:39,982
Negative. You need to fall back immediately.

476
00:42:39,983 --> 00:42:41,514
<i>Do you copy?</i>

477
00:42:41,515 --> 00:42:43,479
Give me this.

478
00:42:52,753 --> 00:42:57,420
Ray, we got work lights.
Something big is going on here.

479
00:43:00,065 --> 00:43:02,486
Ray, do you copy?

480
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,702
Ray, do you copy?

481
00:43:10,138 --> 00:43:12,013
Stop!

482
00:43:24,814 --> 00:43:26,973
Jerry, Run!

483
00:43:38,207 --> 00:43:40,433
- Cover!
- Go!

484
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,080
<i>What the hell is goin' on out there?</i>

485
00:43:56,547 --> 00:43:59,729
We're taking fire, multiple shooters.

486
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,218
<i>I'm almost there!</i>

487
00:44:17,576 --> 00:44:19,810
NVGs on.

488
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:26,951
Kill the lights, now!

489
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:29,241
What...?

490
00:44:38,964 --> 00:44:43,323
You OK, Jerry?
Can you make it to me?

491
00:44:45,053 --> 00:44:46,712
Yeah!

492
00:44:47,997 --> 00:44:49,798
Yeah.

493
00:44:55,731 --> 00:44:56,933
No...

494
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,649
Bailey's over there.
He's been hit.

495
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,057
- I'll cover you.
- Go!

496
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:14,836
Bring me the gun!

497
00:46:21,075 --> 00:46:23,514
Bailey, come on.

498
00:46:31,493 --> 00:46:32,898
Shit!

499
00:46:33,966 --> 00:46:36,368
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

500
00:47:01,511 --> 00:47:03,686
Is anyone following us?

501
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,710
<i>That's a negative.
I didn't see any headlights.</i>

502
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:07,135
Good.

503
00:47:07,136 --> 00:47:08,640
Are you both OK?

504
00:47:08,641 --> 00:47:12,080
- Oh my God, Jerry. You're still bleeding.
- It's nothing. It's nothing.

505
00:47:12,081 --> 00:47:14,783
- Ray...
- Find the wound and apply pressure.

506
00:47:14,784 --> 00:47:16,538
Okay.

507
00:47:17,036 --> 00:47:20,986
I'm Sorry.
It's Ok, it's OK.

508
00:47:20,987 --> 00:47:24,927
I hear uniform blood stains
take forever to get out.

509
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:26,611
Yeah, well, what do I care?

510
00:47:26,612 --> 00:47:29,058
You're the one that's going to
be cleaning it for me anyway.

511
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:31,938
As soon as we get you patched up.

512
00:47:32,027 --> 00:47:34,929
Do you think Frank would be jealous
if he saw us the two of us like this?

513
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:39,514
I know, you can just tell your buddy
that he's just wasting his time, you know.

514
00:47:39,515 --> 00:47:41,426
I don't date prisoners.

515
00:47:41,427 --> 00:47:43,774
Yeah, he likes you too.

516
00:47:44,154 --> 00:47:45,538
Okay.

517
00:47:45,539 --> 00:47:48,301
Hold on, Jerry.

518
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:51,821
Jerry, hang on, Jerry.

519
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:53,929
Ray, hurry.

520
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:57,455
Stay with me, Jerry.

521
00:47:57,584 --> 00:48:00,113
Everything will be fine.

522
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:23,273
Jerry...

523
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,872
Come on.

524
00:48:40,015 --> 00:48:42,024
Ray...

525
00:48:45,837 --> 00:48:48,119
Jerry...

526
00:49:31,758 --> 00:49:33,709
Sarah?

527
00:49:34,895 --> 00:49:37,160
Sarah!

528
00:49:45,673 --> 00:49:48,738
I can't believe he's gone.

529
00:49:52,428 --> 00:49:58,885
He's was talking about you,
only minutes before he died.

530
00:49:59,175 --> 00:50:01,270
What'd he say?

531
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,053
He told me to go easy on you.

532
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,149
That you're not all that bad.

533
00:50:29,648 --> 00:50:31,587
What do you mean cops gave you trouble?

534
00:50:31,588 --> 00:50:33,933
<i>- What kind of trouble?</i>
- Listen...

535
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:35,191
Are you going to be ready on time?

536
00:50:35,192 --> 00:50:38,150
Yes, not gonna be a problem.

537
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:40,623
I expect you to complete your mission.

538
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:43,205
I don't want to hear any excuses.

539
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,871
Oh, shit!

540
00:50:48,206 --> 00:50:51,272
<i>- Bannister here.</i>
- How far is the SWAT team?

541
00:50:51,273 --> 00:50:52,943
45 minutes or so.

542
00:50:52,944 --> 00:50:54,215
- Why?
- <i>Because I need your help.</i>

543
00:50:54,216 --> 00:50:56,897
Your fugitive is trying to cross
the border right around here.

544
00:50:56,898 --> 00:50:58,781
What are you talking about?
There was no crossing at Sommerton.

545
00:50:58,782 --> 00:51:02,246
They're going to build one. Because the
ravine south of town here is very narrow.

546
00:51:02,247 --> 00:51:05,298
There's a whole team out here.
Military background, heavy weapons.

547
00:51:05,299 --> 00:51:07,772
They're building a moblile assault
bridge across that canyon.

548
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:10,522
- Oh really. You think so?
<i>- I know so, I've seen them.</i>

549
00:51:10,523 --> 00:51:13,553
We've been engaged in a
fire fight with those guys.

550
00:51:13,554 --> 00:51:16,929
<i>Now, who the hell is this fugitive anyway?</i>

551
00:51:18,396 --> 00:51:20,552
- Gabriel Cortez.
- What?

552
00:51:20,553 --> 00:51:23,180
<i>Why the fuck didn't you tell me that earlier?</i>

553
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:25,773
My deputy would still be alive
if I would have known that!

554
00:51:25,774 --> 00:51:28,672
You know what? I don't have time to
explain every little detail to you.

555
00:51:28,673 --> 00:51:30,910
Why don't you go out there and patrol,
or something like that?

556
00:51:30,911 --> 00:51:35,054
Look, I don't know you.
And I don't answer to you.

557
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,743
Son of a bitch.

558
00:51:41,881 --> 00:51:44,352
Hung up on me again.

559
00:51:44,545 --> 00:51:46,653
Piss-ant country Sheriff.

560
00:51:46,654 --> 00:51:48,872
Phil, give me the SWAT captain, all right.

561
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:49,950
Got it.

562
00:51:49,951 --> 00:51:53,616
And throw up a map of Sommerton up here for me.
I want to check something out.

563
00:51:57,306 --> 00:51:58,947
- Sir?
- <i>Captain.</i>

564
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:02,626
There's a chance Cortez may
actually try to cross in Sommerton.

565
00:52:02,627 --> 00:52:05,842
<i>When you get there,
if you find bridge, destroy it.</i>

566
00:52:05,843 --> 00:52:07,681
Yes, sir.

567
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:20,385
Mobile assault bridge?

568
00:52:24,522 --> 00:52:28,514
That's SWAT up ahead.
What are you gonna do?

569
00:52:30,056 --> 00:52:34,203
Death doesn't come when you expect it.

570
00:52:34,525 --> 00:52:36,868
Driving a race car...

571
00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:39,640
or in a gunfight.

572
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:47,342
Death is waiting in the kitchen when you
get up at night for a glass of milk.

573
00:52:51,903 --> 00:52:57,094
My niece, my sister's oldest,
she was a good girl.

574
00:52:57,095 --> 00:52:59,717
I practically raised her.

575
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:04,873
Then one night, I find her pointing
a Glock at me in the kitchen.

576
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:13,187
If she hadn't hesitated, it would have been my brains
splattered all over the marble floor, instead of hers.

577
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:29,140
Shit!

578
00:53:30,386 --> 00:53:32,644
Shit!

579
00:53:56,935 --> 00:53:59,303
Don't try to see death coming.

580
00:53:59,304 --> 00:54:01,550
You won't.

581
00:54:12,287 --> 00:54:15,254
SWAT's not coming.

582
00:54:15,269 --> 00:54:17,377
So we're on our own?

583
00:54:17,378 --> 00:54:21,023
Well then, who's gonna stop this guy Cortez?

584
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:22,707
This is on the feds.

585
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,704
He was in their custody.
They lost him.

586
00:54:25,705 --> 00:54:29,130
He should never have been our problem.

587
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:35,021
Maybe not.

588
00:54:35,467 --> 00:54:39,967
But if he comes through our town,
he will be our problem.

589
00:54:39,968 --> 00:54:41,401
Okay, so...

590
00:54:41,402 --> 00:54:43,182
So we can turn our back for a half hour.

591
00:54:43,183 --> 00:54:45,477
We could do that.

592
00:54:47,094 --> 00:54:51,161
If you do that, might as well throw these in the trash.

593
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,523
Ray, let it go.

594
00:54:53,813 --> 00:54:55,989
I can't.

595
00:55:04,158 --> 00:55:08,600
Jerry's dead because of that guy.

596
00:55:10,925 --> 00:55:14,534
Ray, you know me.
I'm not a coward. Look...

597
00:55:14,535 --> 00:55:19,477
I would more than happily draw down
on those guys with you, for Jerry.

598
00:55:19,478 --> 00:55:24,390
But Cortez, he's out of our league.
He's ​​got an army.

599
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:35,576
Look. If you guys want to just step aside,
that's fine with me.

600
00:55:35,713 --> 00:55:38,905
I'm not going to fault you for doing so.

601
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:41,212
But I'm not gonna let that
guy come through our town...

602
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:44,163
without a fight.

603
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:51,139
I took the same oath as you, Ray.

604
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,009
Ray!

605
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:56,436
Looks like you're a little short handed.

606
00:55:56,788 --> 00:55:59,312
You need my help.

607
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:18,107
Are you still as good a shot as you used to be?

608
00:56:18,857 --> 00:56:22,043
Muscle memory lasts a long time.

609
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:26,296
Frank, I've seen you start a lot
of things you didn't finish.

610
00:56:26,297 --> 00:56:28,170
Jerry was my friend.

611
00:56:28,171 --> 00:56:31,593
I've never quit on my friends.

612
00:56:32,857 --> 00:56:35,250
Set him free.

613
00:56:37,254 --> 00:56:39,986
Consider yourself deputized.

614
00:56:39,987 --> 00:56:42,253
I won't let you down.

615
00:56:51,486 --> 00:56:53,954
Ok, ok.

616
00:56:54,016 --> 00:56:58,362
That makes four of us.
You happy?

617
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,224
Phil.

618
00:57:17,614 --> 00:57:20,584
I want you to pull financials
on everybody in this division.

619
00:57:20,585 --> 00:57:23,094
Including me. No exceptions.

620
00:57:23,095 --> 00:57:25,534
Cortez has somebody on the inside.

621
00:57:25,535 --> 00:57:29,856
Somebody who tipped him off when we were
about to move, and I want to know who it is.

622
00:57:29,857 --> 00:57:31,552
All right?

623
00:58:07,835 --> 00:58:10,098
Ray, I...

624
00:58:11,389 --> 00:58:13,807
I gotta tell you...

625
00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:18,291
When Jerry and I were being shot at...

626
00:58:18,292 --> 00:58:20,760
I was scared shitless.

627
00:58:20,761 --> 00:58:25,256
I mean, I could barely keep my hands from shaking.

628
00:58:25,257 --> 00:58:27,242
That's quite normal.

629
00:58:27,243 --> 00:58:31,355
I mean, everyone feels like that during a fire fight.

630
00:58:36,765 --> 00:58:40,276
I tell you a secret.

631
00:58:42,628 --> 00:58:47,321
I'm probably more afraid than you are right now.

632
00:58:49,488 --> 00:58:51,705
How can that be?

633
00:58:51,706 --> 00:58:55,210
Because I've seen enough blood and death.

634
00:58:55,211 --> 00:58:57,903
I know what's coming.

635
00:59:17,557 --> 00:59:19,552
I want you to ask Washington

636
00:59:19,553 --> 00:59:22,985
to get us real time satellite imagery
of the area surrounding Sommerton.

637
00:59:22,986 --> 00:59:24,494
You know if this sheriff is right,

638
00:59:24,495 --> 00:59:26,785
and we've got a hundred
federal agents standing around

639
00:59:26,786 --> 00:59:30,135
Los Algodones crossing with their
dicks in their hands for no reason.

640
00:59:30,136 --> 00:59:31,572
What's the fastest way to get there?

641
00:59:31,573 --> 00:59:33,969
We can charter a jet out of McCarren.

642
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,569
Do it.

643
00:59:36,343 --> 00:59:38,129
Ready?

644
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:43,031
Yeah, but how are we going to go up against all
that firepower with a bunch of shotguns and knives?

645
00:59:43,032 --> 00:59:45,632
I got an idea.

646
00:59:52,414 --> 00:59:56,408
I got two conditions that need
to be met before we do anything.

647
00:59:56,409 --> 00:59:57,751
Well, name it.

648
00:59:57,752 --> 01:00:00,446
I want to be deputized like Frank here...

649
01:00:00,447 --> 01:00:02,107
so any damage caused to or by me

650
01:00:02,108 --> 01:00:06,615
will be official business of the
Sommerton Juctions Sheriff's office.

651
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,946
Put ​​your hand on it.

652
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:19,235
I do hereby instate one Lewis Dinkum

653
01:00:19,236 --> 01:00:23,102
who'll serve as deputy from this day forward,
or until his services are no longer required

654
01:00:23,103 --> 01:00:25,644
by the people of Sommerton Junction.

655
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:27,414
- Witness?
- Witness.

656
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,224
- What else?
- Huh?

657
01:00:34,225 --> 01:00:37,088
Second condition.

658
01:00:37,522 --> 01:00:39,791
Oh, I want to hang on to ole Georgetta here.

659
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:42,024
Seeing as I'm the only one fit to handle her.

660
01:00:42,025 --> 01:00:43,506
Ok. Let's go.

661
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:45,287
I mean, you can handle her too, Ray.

662
01:00:45,288 --> 01:00:47,131
And you too, Frank.
You might be able to handle her.

663
01:00:47,132 --> 01:00:49,724
- Well thanks, Lewis.
- Well, let's go.

664
01:00:51,916 --> 01:00:54,316
<i>Voila!</i>

665
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:55,909
Jesus Christ, Lewis.

666
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:58,133
Shit.

667
01:00:58,213 --> 01:01:00,041
What a beauty.

668
01:01:00,042 --> 01:01:02,293
- Where the hell did you get this?
- Vicky?

669
01:01:02,294 --> 01:01:06,509
She's my little Nazi killer.
1939 Vickers gun.

670
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:09,088
My little crazy bitch.

671
01:01:09,089 --> 01:01:12,292
Of course she can't really fire
in the legal sense though.

672
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,563
But I did run down all the missing parts for her.

673
01:01:14,564 --> 01:01:16,760
So she could function theoretically.

674
01:01:16,761 --> 01:01:20,513
Course that's between us and Jesus.
Uncle Sam don't need to know nothin' about that.

675
01:01:20,514 --> 01:01:23,295
- You have more ammo?
- A few rounds.

676
01:01:23,296 --> 01:01:25,548
Well, bring everything you got.

677
01:02:02,028 --> 01:02:05,430
What do you think,
we are fighting in the crusade?

678
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:07,483
You never know.

679
01:02:22,383 --> 01:02:25,305
We meet on Main Street in five.

680
01:02:25,306 --> 01:02:28,191
We need as many vehicles
as possible, for the blockade.

681
01:02:28,192 --> 01:02:30,409
I'll drive ole Henrietta here.

682
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:32,521
You have stupid names for all your shit?

683
01:02:32,522 --> 01:02:35,176
Only the shit I love.

684
01:02:35,815 --> 01:02:37,469
Let's go.

685
01:02:48,646 --> 01:02:51,163
All right. I'll brief you when we touch down.

686
01:02:52,253 --> 01:02:53,892
Update me.

687
01:02:53,893 --> 01:02:56,928
Border Patrol is putting a team together
but they won't be there for over an hour.

688
01:02:56,929 --> 01:02:58,712
- National Guard?
- Longer.

689
01:02:58,713 --> 01:03:00,148
What about the military?

690
01:03:00,149 --> 01:03:01,708
It takes a presidential order.

691
01:03:01,709 --> 01:03:04,239
We're not going to get that in the next 45 minutes.

692
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,037
Now Cortez has to come through Main Street

693
01:03:22,038 --> 01:03:23,670
in order to get to the canyon.

694
01:03:23,671 --> 01:03:25,799
The only other option is Asamora.

695
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:29,210
Torrance, you take Frank and Lewis
and block that off.

696
01:03:29,211 --> 01:03:31,117
And Fig and I are going to warn the civilians.

697
01:03:31,118 --> 01:03:33,026
Got it.

698
01:03:35,267 --> 01:03:37,172
- Hey, Ray.
- Listen guys...

699
01:03:37,173 --> 01:03:39,677
There is an escaped fugitive coming through town.

700
01:03:39,678 --> 01:03:44,027
It's too dangerous for you to stay here.
I want everyone to go home.

701
01:03:48,281 --> 01:03:51,127
Did you hear what I just said?

702
01:03:53,009 --> 01:03:54,941
We just ordered breakfast.

703
01:03:54,942 --> 01:03:56,698
It's for your own safety.

704
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:59,881
You're talking to a 72 year
old man with high cholesterol

705
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:02,566
eating a bacon and cheddar
omelet with extra cheddar.

706
01:04:02,567 --> 01:04:05,238
Do I look like I'm afraid of death?

707
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:10,476
Don't look at me.
I ordered the same thing.

708
01:04:11,054 --> 01:04:14,035
Well, I just started cooking.

709
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:18,535
- Where's Christie?
- Went to get milk.

710
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:24,699
Just stay away from the windows, Ok?

711
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,990
Stay away from the windows.

712
01:04:26,991 --> 01:04:29,712
- Okay.
- We can do that.

713
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,733
All right.
How do you want to do this?

714
01:04:33,734 --> 01:04:38,272
All right, lets put your truck on the far side
and then try to find some more cars to use.

715
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,537
I've got a better idea.

716
01:04:40,538 --> 01:04:42,555
- We might need somthin' bigger.
- Yeah.

717
01:04:42,556 --> 01:04:46,239
Maybe three on this side.
Have to be enough to fill it in.

718
01:04:49,823 --> 01:04:51,714
What are you planning to do?

719
01:04:51,715 --> 01:04:54,208
- Just stay back.
- No Dinkum, what about the lines?

720
01:04:54,209 --> 01:04:57,622
This is the phone and cable.
Electricity's over there.

721
01:04:57,623 --> 01:05:01,638
No, that's not what I mean.
If you cut the phone lines...

722
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:12,310
Geronimo!

723
01:05:12,311 --> 01:05:14,689
- Geronimo!
- Get back. Get back!

724
01:05:20,142 --> 01:05:22,002
Fucking perfect.

725
01:05:22,758 --> 01:05:24,766
Let's get some cars in place.

726
01:05:24,767 --> 01:05:26,938
Well, shit!

727
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:30,656
Jesus.

728
01:05:31,897 --> 01:05:33,019
John?

729
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,659
- You'd better take a look at this.
- What is it?

730
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,412
The Satellite feed from Home Security,
this is the live view of the canyon

731
01:05:37,413 --> 01:05:39,254
just south of Sommerton Junction.

732
01:05:39,255 --> 01:05:40,735
Look at that.

733
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:43,592
- That's a bridge?
- Yeah.

734
01:05:43,593 --> 01:05:46,346
I don't believe it.

735
01:05:46,347 --> 01:05:49,787
The Sheriff was right.
Who is this guy?

736
01:05:50,809 --> 01:05:53,342
In 1988, Owens joined the LAPD.

737
01:05:53,343 --> 01:05:55,543
He trained under their Elite Tactical Division.

738
01:05:55,569 --> 01:05:57,819
Worked Narcotics for five years, then he quit.

739
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:58,846
Why?

740
01:05:58,847 --> 01:06:02,568
Well, he crashed a party on some
bad guys movin' a half ton of coke.

741
01:06:02,569 --> 01:06:05,883
He took home the Medal of Valor.
Five bullet holes for his trouble.

742
01:06:05,884 --> 01:06:08,944
Owens lived, but seven other cops didn't.

743
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:10,785
So that was it for Owens.

744
01:06:10,786 --> 01:06:13,110
Guess he'd seen enough bloodshed,
so he walked away.

745
01:06:13,111 --> 01:06:15,727
He went to Sommerton to play Sheriff.

746
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:20,449
Thanks.

747
01:06:23,258 --> 01:06:24,946
Yeah, we need two more.

748
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:27,493
Oh my God! What are you doing Dinkum?

749
01:06:27,494 --> 01:06:30,574
- Have you lost your mind, you idiot!
- Settle down.

750
01:06:30,575 --> 01:06:33,058
I almost got it.

751
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:36,198
- Dinkum!
- Don't do that!

752
01:06:38,146 --> 01:06:41,423
Dinkum!
Dinkum, are you okay?

753
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:44,929
Oh my God, are you all right?

754
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:50,527
- Henryetta?
- It worked!

755
01:06:52,473 --> 01:06:56,454
Nice job, deputy.
Nice job.

756
01:07:07,422 --> 01:07:10,203
Ray, we're gonna need something bigger than this.

757
01:07:10,515 --> 01:07:11,995
I got an idea.

758
01:07:11,996 --> 01:07:14,313
- Torrance.
- <i> Asamora's blocked off.</i>

759
01:07:14,314 --> 01:07:18,123
Good. Have Dinkum and Martinez
meet me in the school yard.

760
01:07:18,124 --> 01:07:20,719
And I need you to be on top
of the roof of the old hotel

761
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,201
to be my spotter.

762
01:07:22,202 --> 01:07:25,837
Figgy, you go to the Southside and
check if the buildings are cleared, okay?

763
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:28,139
- I'll be right back.
- On my way.

764
01:07:46,282 --> 01:07:49,822
Time for a turkey shoot.

765
01:08:05,369 --> 01:08:07,643
Oh, shit!

766
01:08:25,222 --> 01:08:27,945
I got guys on Main Street
approaching from the South.

767
01:08:27,946 --> 01:08:30,297
<i>Do not engage,
wait for us to get there.</i>

768
01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:32,358
Copy that, Ray.

769
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:54,149
What the hell is that?

770
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:57,298
This is gonna be a lot of fun!

771
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,817
I'll need two guys on the left.

772
01:09:00,948 --> 01:09:03,337
You two take the right.

773
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:08,235
Shoot anything that moves.

774
01:09:08,325 --> 01:09:12,638
If it doesn't move, shoot it anyway.

775
01:09:14,048 --> 01:09:20,044
Once our work is done here,
we're gonna burn this place to the ground!

776
01:09:34,427 --> 01:09:36,232
Christie!

777
01:09:36,233 --> 01:09:39,037
- Jesus, Figgy?
- Christie, you have to get out of here, now!

778
01:09:39,038 --> 01:09:42,642
What the hell's goin' on?
What are these cars parked for?

779
01:09:42,643 --> 01:09:45,205
Look at that ass.

780
01:09:46,971 --> 01:09:50,618
- Christie, you have to get off the street, baby.
- Why are you hiding behind a car?

781
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:53,939
I could kill for that ass.

782
01:09:54,236 --> 01:09:55,784
Shit!

783
01:10:00,838 --> 01:10:02,181
Come on! Come on!

784
01:10:02,182 --> 01:10:03,954
Go! Go!

785
01:10:04,342 --> 01:10:06,652
Get down! Get down!

786
01:10:07,753 --> 01:10:09,189
Come on! Come on, come on!

787
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:11,657
Get to the diner!
Get to the diner!

788
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:21,765
Is that the best you got?

789
01:10:36,645 --> 01:10:40,379
Look at that squirrel
with that big motherfucker hat.

790
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:43,462
This is getting boring.
Get the big gun!

791
01:10:44,455 --> 01:10:46,967
Oh Shit. Shit.

792
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,839
Yeah. Give him something to remember.

793
01:10:55,367 --> 01:10:58,025
Oh, shit!

794
01:11:24,465 --> 01:11:26,903
Take him out!

795
01:11:37,005 --> 01:11:39,028
Get him!

796
01:11:40,376 --> 01:11:42,427
Figgy!

797
01:11:45,078 --> 01:11:47,299
All clear...

798
01:12:01,924 --> 01:12:04,045
What the fuck happened?!

799
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:10,031
- <i> Torrance, are you okay?</i>
- I'm Ok, Ray.

800
01:12:10,652 --> 01:12:13,419
But Figgy's down.

801
01:12:37,705 --> 01:12:39,704
Damn!

802
01:12:49,521 --> 01:12:51,823
Now, what the hell is that?

803
01:13:32,226 --> 01:13:35,518
Welcome to Sommerton.

804
01:13:38,214 --> 01:13:41,727
Nice shooting, Sheriff.

805
01:13:46,301 --> 01:13:49,468
Get this the bus into position.

806
01:13:50,704 --> 01:13:54,028
- Vámonos!
- I got it! I'm on it!

807
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:12,490
We're in place!

808
01:14:13,123 --> 01:14:14,842
Get down!

809
01:14:16,207 --> 01:14:19,223
Torrance, where is the fire coming from?

810
01:14:20,659 --> 01:14:23,347
Behind you.
Roof next to the diner.

811
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:25,909
- Cover me guys!
- Yes, Sir!

812
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:47,273
- How are you, Sheriff?
- Old.

813
01:14:47,328 --> 01:14:50,007
Ah, you got a ways to go yet.

814
01:14:50,008 --> 01:14:52,071
Oh my God Sheriff, you've been shot.

815
01:14:52,072 --> 01:14:54,173
- Somebody help him!
- I see it. Hold on.

816
01:14:54,174 --> 01:14:56,701
Don't worry, it's just glass.

817
01:14:58,478 --> 01:15:02,468
- Where are the stairs to the roof?
- Over there.

818
01:15:42,113 --> 01:15:44,580
He's goin' after Sarah.
We have to warn her.

819
01:15:44,581 --> 01:15:45,734
Give me the radio!

820
01:15:45,735 --> 01:15:48,117
- Give the radio!
- We don't got no damn radio!

821
01:15:48,118 --> 01:15:50,707
We got nunchuks though!

822
01:15:51,484 --> 01:15:54,319
- Just cover me!
- Cover you?

823
01:15:56,736 --> 01:15:58,487
What the hell?

824
01:16:49,578 --> 01:16:51,327
Sarah!

825
01:17:02,035 --> 01:17:04,301
Does this mean I'm forgiven?

826
01:17:04,302 --> 01:17:06,802
Probably.

827
01:17:10,383 --> 01:17:11,587
Shit!

828
01:17:11,588 --> 01:17:13,223
Thorzetta!

829
01:17:19,733 --> 01:17:22,001
God damn cowbell!

830
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:30,376
Fuck!

831
01:17:41,011 --> 01:17:43,426
Jesus.

832
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:52,285
Motherfucker.

833
01:18:01,212 --> 01:18:04,930
- No trespassing!
- Quiet Granny.

834
01:18:16,138 --> 01:18:20,652
- Mrs. Salazar?
- Sheriff.

835
01:18:21,165 --> 01:18:23,804
Obliged!

836
01:18:23,989 --> 01:18:27,240
Put the hurt on em', Ray!

837
01:18:27,241 --> 01:18:28,972
Okay.

838
01:18:35,803 --> 01:18:38,217
- Figgy?
- Lewis, what are you doing?!

839
01:18:38,218 --> 01:18:39,865
Figgy's over here...

840
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:52,164
Fuck!

841
01:18:59,724 --> 01:19:00,992
Ray!

842
01:19:00,993 --> 01:19:03,742
You get Dinkum.
I'll cover you!

843
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,596
I've got you.

844
01:19:14,814 --> 01:19:16,626
Come on.

845
01:19:26,577 --> 01:19:28,379
Jesus.

846
01:19:28,804 --> 01:19:32,218
- What are you doing out there?
- I'm a deputy.

847
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:33,764
Lewis.

848
01:19:52,525 --> 01:19:55,254
Hey!
Here I am!

849
01:19:59,176 --> 01:20:01,766
You little motherfucker!

850
01:20:02,638 --> 01:20:06,329
Come on! Shoot!

851
01:20:08,802 --> 01:20:11,417
Where the fuck are you?

852
01:20:12,985 --> 01:20:16,001
Little rat. You wanna play?

853
01:20:16,002 --> 01:20:18,316
I love to play.

854
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:22,262
Okay.

855
01:20:23,579 --> 01:20:25,699
Oh shit!

856
01:21:12,311 --> 01:21:14,798
Drop the weapon.

857
01:21:21,903 --> 01:21:24,826
Who the hell are you?

858
01:21:30,809 --> 01:21:33,530
I am the Sheriff.

859
01:21:55,792 --> 01:21:57,654
<i>I'm here.</i>

860
01:21:57,655 --> 01:21:59,954
<i>Do you copy?</i>

861
01:22:00,293 --> 01:22:02,286
<i>Are you ready for me?</i>

862
01:22:02,287 --> 01:22:04,378
We will be.

863
01:22:49,579 --> 01:22:53,909
You're very good in close quarters, aren't you?

864
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:57,665
You're very beautiful, Agent Richards.

865
01:23:03,409 --> 01:23:08,775
And nothing would give me greater pleasure...

866
01:23:10,162 --> 01:23:12,729
than to demonstrate...

867
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:16,912
How good I really am.

868
01:23:21,636 --> 01:23:26,246
But since you're still going to need
to look the part of an escaped hostage,

869
01:23:26,247 --> 01:23:31,320
consider this a goodbye gift.

870
01:23:33,179 --> 01:23:35,534
What do you mean?

871
01:23:58,788 --> 01:24:01,069
What the fuck?!

872
01:24:05,646 --> 01:24:07,203
Shit!

873
01:24:10,289 --> 01:24:11,769
So you want to play?

874
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:13,683
Let's play!

875
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:29,654
Yeah!

876
01:24:35,906 --> 01:24:38,075
Now what?

877
01:24:41,061 --> 01:24:42,545
Shit.

878
01:26:47,129 --> 01:26:49,441
Son of a bitch!

879
01:26:52,819 --> 01:26:54,600
Fuck!

880
01:27:01,087 --> 01:27:02,902
I'm gonna kill you!

881
01:27:08,181 --> 01:27:10,146
Shit!

882
01:29:23,448 --> 01:29:26,103
You fucked up my car.

883
01:29:26,104 --> 01:29:29,421
You fucked up my day off.

884
01:29:31,855 --> 01:29:33,575
You know what, Sheriff?

885
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:38,216
All you have to do is let me
walk across that border.

886
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:43,567
Hell, twelve thousand
Mexicans come across every day.

887
01:29:43,568 --> 01:29:46,934
You shouldn't mind if one goes back.

888
01:29:46,935 --> 01:29:48,686
What do you say?

889
01:29:48,687 --> 01:29:52,496
You make us immigrants look bad.

890
01:29:55,485 --> 01:29:57,717
Well then,

891
01:29:57,718 --> 01:30:00,924
let's discuss my deportation, shall we?

892
01:30:03,821 --> 01:30:05,716
<i>Carlos, uno momento.</i>

893
01:30:06,842 --> 01:30:08,766
This is my personal banker.

894
01:30:08,767 --> 01:30:10,508
Simply tell him your account number.

895
01:30:10,509 --> 01:30:13,191
You will be five million dollars richer.

896
01:30:13,192 --> 01:30:15,884
We will part as friends.

897
01:30:25,378 --> 01:30:27,678
Ten million.

898
01:30:33,971 --> 01:30:35,582
Put those on...

899
01:30:35,583 --> 01:30:37,754
or I will.

900
01:30:43,533 --> 01:30:46,695
Maybe once upon a time.

901
01:30:50,022 --> 01:30:53,145
Your time is over <i>abuelito.</i>

902
01:30:53,146 --> 01:30:56,304
My time is just starting.

903
01:31:06,872 --> 01:31:08,758
Game on.

904
01:32:07,904 --> 01:32:10,617
You should have taken the money, old man!

905
01:33:32,549 --> 01:33:35,484
Ok! Ok!

906
01:33:36,775 --> 01:33:38,381
Twenty million.

907
01:33:38,382 --> 01:33:42,531
Twenty million dollars just to look the other way.

908
01:33:42,923 --> 01:33:45,262
My honor is not for sale.

909
01:33:45,263 --> 01:33:48,030
Fuck your honor!

910
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:22,915
You are under arrest.

911
01:34:46,830 --> 01:34:49,716
Here comes the cavalry.

912
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:55,831
- John Bannister, FBI.
- Glad you could make it.

913
01:34:57,777 --> 01:34:59,518
So what happened here?
Where's Cortez?

914
01:34:59,519 --> 01:35:00,995
The Sheriff went after him.

915
01:35:00,996 --> 01:35:04,948
I'm more concerned about him right now
than I am about Cortez.

916
01:35:05,827 --> 01:35:08,901
Looks like you're both in luck.

917
01:35:26,439 --> 01:35:28,457
Look at that.

918
01:35:29,404 --> 01:35:32,688
Good thing.
Good for him.

919
01:35:37,121 --> 01:35:41,160
One last time. Only this time,
the surprise is on you.

920
01:35:41,161 --> 01:35:43,487
Let's go guys.

921
01:35:49,271 --> 01:35:51,813
John!

922
01:35:52,332 --> 01:35:54,388
Richards!

923
01:35:54,389 --> 01:35:56,316
Are you Ok?

924
01:35:56,317 --> 01:35:58,173
Yeah, I'm Ok.

925
01:35:58,174 --> 01:35:59,941
I'm so sorry, John.

926
01:35:59,942 --> 01:36:04,143
He was going to kill me.
It's so good to see you.

927
01:36:04,144 --> 01:36:08,563
Yeah, I'll glad he didn't.
I'm really glad he didn't.

928
01:36:08,564 --> 01:36:15,193
Because that would have cost me the satisfaction
of being able to arrest you myself.

929
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:20,723
I know the two of you are
use to being driving buddies.

930
01:36:21,378 --> 01:36:23,684
And for your information, Swiss bank accounts

931
01:36:23,685 --> 01:36:25,642
are not as secret as they use to be.

932
01:36:25,643 --> 01:36:27,463
Let's go.

933
01:36:34,737 --> 01:36:36,582
Shit!

934
01:36:36,987 --> 01:36:39,683
That's why I shot him.

935
01:36:41,094 --> 01:36:42,420
I can walk!

936
01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:44,887
Just because a man gets wounded
in the line on duty

937
01:36:44,888 --> 01:36:46,545
don't mean he can't walk.
I don't want that.

938
01:36:46,546 --> 01:36:49,032
Way to go, Ray, Martinez, Torrance.

939
01:36:49,033 --> 01:36:50,563
I can walk.

940
01:36:50,564 --> 01:36:54,718
Maybe if Christie wants to help me, she could.

941
01:36:55,423 --> 01:36:58,629
- Thanks little one.
- Anytime, Lewis.

942
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:02,377
Figgy!

943
01:37:04,366 --> 01:37:05,311
Figgy!

944
01:37:06,312 --> 01:37:08,550
Sorry!

945
01:37:08,551 --> 01:37:09,730
Let me see, let me see.

946
01:37:10,231 --> 01:37:13,296
- That's a .50 caliber.
- That's a painful .50.

947
01:37:14,597 --> 01:37:16,564
Look at that.

948
01:37:16,965 --> 01:37:17,561
What about you?

949
01:37:17,862 --> 01:37:19,454
I'm fine.

950
01:37:19,955 --> 01:37:23,416
Oh, please, come on.
That's a BB gun.

951
01:37:23,417 --> 01:37:25,424
Let's finish the report and get out of here.

952
01:37:25,425 --> 01:37:26,564
Good.

953
01:37:28,819 --> 01:37:34,231
I'll say it.
I completely underestimated you, Sheriff.

954
01:37:35,046 --> 01:37:37,334
It's Ok.

955
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:52,393
You're a hell of a lawman.
And you don't give up too easy.

956
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:54,241
You're right.

957
01:37:54,242 --> 01:37:56,750
This is my home.

958
01:37:57,486 --> 01:37:59,465
Impressive.

959
01:38:01,052 --> 01:38:03,319
Impressive.

960
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:09,550
Sheriff...

961
01:38:15,924 --> 01:38:17,171
Keep it.

962
01:38:20,957 --> 01:38:23,333
You earned it.

963
01:38:25,683 --> 01:38:28,998
- Thanks, Ray.
- Jerry would want you to have it.

964
01:38:29,005 --> 01:38:30,881
Thanks.

965
01:38:38,039 --> 01:38:40,383
Ray!

966
01:38:40,977 --> 01:38:45,304
What in God's name happened to my car?

967
01:38:45,305 --> 01:38:49,197
Next time don't park it in the fire zone.

968
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:54,603
Schmuck.

969
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:04,903
