00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:15,624
THE RED AND THE BLACK
Part Two

2
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:59,994
THE RED AND THE BLACK
A Chronicle of 1830

3
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:29,334
Roberto! Sorel's boots.

4
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:35,751
Ah, there.

5
00:02:38,222 --> 00:02:40,013
Come on, move along.

6
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:44,389
The left foot, please.

7
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:47,480
There ... now the other one.

8
00:02:48,273 --> 00:02:49,768
There we are.

9
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:52,934
Very good, nice!

10
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,940
Want to walk a little?

11
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,693
Try them out.

12
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:00,030
Move your feet.

13
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,696
You've noticed our little museum?

14
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:07,579
These shoes are the emperor's.

15
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:09,792
- You made shoes for the Emperor?
- Yes.

16
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:13,295
We've fitted the court of
France for 150 years.

17
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:14,830
Anyone here?

18
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,004
Have a care, sir!

19
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:19,591
For that?

20
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,058
If only there was a foot inside.
And as for these shoes...

21
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,930
Enough of this, sir.

22
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:28,516
Keep out of it.

23
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:30,726
Your address?

24
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:33,521
You've got no shoes, and
you want an appointment?

25
00:03:33,944 --> 00:03:34,975
Signori! No!

26
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:37,064
- Calm down, please!
- You offend me.

27
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:38,354
Your address.

28
00:03:38,782 --> 00:03:40,277
Calm down, signori.

29
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:41,613
You offend me.

30
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:43,567
Give him your card, sir!

31
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,913
My card? I have cards! Ha!

32
00:03:49,752 --> 00:03:51,162
You're lucky.

33
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,540
If one of those had touched me, I
would've killed you on the spot.

34
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:57,835
Bastard! Watch your mouth!

35
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:04,930
I don't know anyone in Paris.

36
00:04:05,184 --> 00:04:07,426
Would you be my second?

37
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:09,145
Who is this man?

38
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:10,772
The Marquis de Croisenois.

39
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:13,893
I've never seen him before,
but I know that name.

40
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:17,070
I think I've already fitted that family.

41
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,693
I'll be your second on one condition.

42
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:22,736
If you don't wound the
wretch, you'll fight me.

43
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:24,692
Agreed, sir.

44
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,490
This is done in Paris?

45
00:04:27,748 --> 00:04:30,321
When we don't have the honour of knowing.

46
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:32,577
Where do you live?

47
00:04:38,008 --> 00:04:40,048
46, rue de Varenne.

48
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:42,510
Could you tell me where it is?

49
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:44,839
I must introduce myself today.

50
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:02,354
Here we are, my friend.

51
00:05:02,783 --> 00:05:05,404
Is that all? Is that some
contribution to parish costs?

52
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:07,036
- Sir!
- What?

53
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:08,450
- Hooligan!.
- It's nothing.

54
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:10,449
I'll bust his head.

55
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,035
This isn't the time to have
a fight on my hands.

56
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:16,790
The Marquis is waiting.

57
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:20,793
You wear the black coat well.

58
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,589
Too elegant for a clergyman?

59
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:26,134
Yes, but good enough for mourning.

60
00:05:59,757 --> 00:06:02,045
Here there's a whole nation of lackeys.

61
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:06,168
They'll be jealous by definition,
they'll tend traps.

62
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,755
I defy them. Let them try.

63
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:10,849
- Gentlemen ...
- They will try.

64
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:20,233
Marquis, this is Julien Sorel.

65
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:26,229
And here is the Marquis
de La Mole. Welcome.

66
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:33,195
The coat's fine.

67
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,658
How many shirts did you bring?

68
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:36,949
Two.

69
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:40,414
That's a start.  Get twenty more. Norbert!

70
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:44,588
I beg your kindness: M. Sorel
is now part of my staff,

71
00:06:44,843 --> 00:06:47,928
and I intend to make a man
of him, if it can be done.

72
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,591
Do you ride?

73
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:52,925
No more than half a dozen times.

74
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:55,723
Well, next time will be the seventh.

75
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,687
Tomorrow, then?

76
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,109
Do you object if he takes dance lessons?

77
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:08,116
- Well, he's not a priest...
- It'll do him good.

78
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:13,076
He has a certain something of the
Provinces which can be refined.

79
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,947
Don't you think so?

80
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:24,958
Arsene, you're in M. Sorel's service.

81
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:31,426
Ah, I almost forgot to tell you ...

82
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:37,558
Every day at 5:30, you will
need to dress for dinner,

83
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,305
and don't forget your beautiful
shoes and stockings.

84
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:42,640
See you later.

85
00:07:50,534 --> 00:07:51,613
Well?

86
00:07:51,994 --> 00:07:54,200
Terribly urbane, isn't he?

87
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:58,287
It's not words that hurt me.

88
00:07:58,542 --> 00:08:00,950
Am I no more a man of the church?

89
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:03,453
Yes, but what am I to them?

90
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:06,466
A valet necessary for their salvation.

91
00:08:07,176 --> 00:08:09,168
I won't be staying here long.

92
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:12,762
There's wealth for
a man of our dress

93
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:14,557
from these lords.

94
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:16,718
I won't bear it.

95
00:08:16,977 --> 00:08:18,436
You'll need to, though.

96
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,763
I'll always have dinner with them?

97
00:08:21,023 --> 00:08:24,356
It is a duty or a kindness for me?

98
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,231
- It's a distinguished honour.
- I don't want it.

99
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:31,437
Get me permission to have
dinner in a dark hostel.

100
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:52,220
That's Mademoiselle de la Mole,
the Marquis' daughter.

101
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:56,255
- I hope she didn't hear you.
- I do.

102
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:58,509
She couldn't despise you any less.

103
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,770
The son of a carpenter
in the pay of her father.

104
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:04,264
You have no idea of that contempt.

105
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:07,230
You'll be paid exaggerated compliments.

106
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:10,404
If you're a fool you'll get used to them.

107
00:09:10,656 --> 00:09:14,523
If you want to make a fortune
you'll have to accept it.

108
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:36,462
Yes sir?

109
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:45,812
I'd like to see M. Croisenois.

110
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:48,481
At this hour?

111
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:50,859
Give him his card.

112
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:59,078
A further arrogance.

113
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,458
This man will leave us in the hall.

114
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,951
He'll make us wait three quarters
of an hour while he curls his hair.

115
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:08,038
Then I'll kill him twice.

116
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:11,165
To see that boorish face yesterday,

117
00:10:11,425 --> 00:10:13,714
I wouldn't have imagined
an elegant place like this.

118
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:15,000
Don't you think?

119
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:18,133
Huh? Sorry, I hadn't noticed.

120
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:25,767
That's my name, sir, but
I don't know the honour.

121
00:10:26,398 --> 00:10:27,976
I came here to fight with you.

122
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,229
I figured.

123
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:32,023
It would be ungracious to refuse you.

124
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,690
But, really ...

125
00:10:35,115 --> 00:10:36,657
I was insulted yesterday.

126
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:37,905
That's too bad.

127
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,942
Sir!

128
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:41,326
I won't refuse a pistol.

129
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,955
Thank you, sir.

130
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:46,492
But M. Sorel has no quarrel with you,

131
00:10:46,752 --> 00:10:49,421
because another stole your card.

132
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:52,334
How regretful.

133
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,925
Another time, maybe.

134
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:09,138
His vest is from Staub, that's clear.

135
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,354
It's in good taste, the boots are fine.

136
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:14,770
But a black coat this early in the morning?

137
00:11:19,827 --> 00:11:20,573
There he is!

138
00:11:20,828 --> 00:11:23,070
I know you, you oaf!

139
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:44,720
What is it?

140
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,895
He's the one who threw
your cards at me.

141
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:50,685
In that case, there's
grounds for a duel.

142
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:53,978
I should think so.
I'll dismiss this rogue.

143
00:11:56,405 --> 00:11:57,650
By your leave.

144
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:02,910
Gentlemen ...

145
00:12:03,162 --> 00:12:04,822
Let's go somewhere quiet.

146
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,452
Do you use firearms?

147
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,329
No. We fight with swords.

148
00:12:22,473 --> 00:12:23,422
Sir!

149
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:25,005
Sir!

150
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:51,249
It rains, it rains, O shepherdess,
Now bring in your white sheep...

151
00:12:51,835 --> 00:12:54,243
Come into the cottage...

152
00:12:54,505 --> 00:12:55,335
Good evening.

153
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:57,498
Quickly, Sheperdhess, let us go...

154
00:12:57,758 --> 00:12:59,382
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

155
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,292
Good evening.

156
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:03,795
I've got news of M. Sorel.

157
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,677
- Is he sick?
- I shot him in the arm this morning.

158
00:13:06,934 --> 00:13:07,515
What?

159
00:13:07,768 --> 00:13:09,559
You shot M. Sorel?

160
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:12,018
I didn't know who he was.

161
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:15,109
To be beaten by your secretary,

162
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:17,150
that would be a ridiculous possibility.

163
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:27,577
You have some ability,
but I advise you to wait,

164
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,118
before your first duel.
It will be safer.

165
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,116
You didn't say
that you were injured.

166
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:34,958
It's nothing.

167
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:37,706
I fell off a horse.

168
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:43,465
Your horse just came to tell me the news.

169
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:06,943
I have an admirable idea.

170
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:10,115
And Madame de la Mole
just gave it to me.

171
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:11,993
Ah, here he is.

172
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,040
M. Sorel, do you mind
if we said ...

173
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:23,875
The idea came from you,
you can say it better.

174
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:27,798
Well ...

175
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,925
M. Croisenois has a romantic spirit.

176
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:35,222
He's fought with the son of a friend.

177
00:14:35,481 --> 00:14:37,806
A gentleman whose
name we will withhold.

178
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:42,653
And not with the son of some carpenter.

179
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:44,565
That's it.

180
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:47,493
I'll stick to this story.

181
00:14:47,743 --> 00:14:49,321
If M. Sorel allows it.

182
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:54,656
I see.

183
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,623
I appreciate this honour.

184
00:14:57,878 --> 00:15:01,164
You've accomplished a big
step in your life in Paris.

185
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:02,502
Let's have dinner.

186
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,890
In a dark hostel?

187
00:15:27,242 --> 00:15:34,879
The first law of all being is self-preservation.
You sow hemlock and expect to see ripening corn.

188
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:53,098
Arsene, bring my luggage.

189
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,447
So? Is it him?

190
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,700
It's funny, he already has an English bearing.

191
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:15,072
Well, after three weeks in London
to discuss my case...

192
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:16,659
He saw many Englishmen?

193
00:16:16,915 --> 00:16:18,707
Their jurists are alike.

194
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,533
But the laws aren't the same.

195
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:23,539
That's the first proof
of their foolishness.

196
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:27,795
- Where did you get these ideas?
- In the books you won't let me read.

197
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,961
I've forbidden you from that.

198
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,221
You wouldn't like it if I was stupid.

199
00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:36,012
I know, but you could try a little.

200
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:37,347
From time to time.

201
00:16:40,064 --> 00:16:40,894
Enter!

202
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,012
Ah, hello, Sorel.

203
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:46,725
It seems that you are a little English.

204
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:47,983
According to my daughter.

205
00:16:48,238 --> 00:16:50,694
Unfortunately, I don't like them much.

206
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:52,278
What have they done?

207
00:16:52,534 --> 00:16:54,077
To me, nothing, miss.

208
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:55,952
You got my letters?

209
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:59,122
All ended well, your case is won.

210
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,375
- You worked well.
- Let's just say I worked.

211
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:05,000
To work enough is to work well.

212
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,631
Well said.

213
00:17:07,549 --> 00:17:08,960
If you'd allow me ...

214
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:12,755
What ideas have you brought us from abroad?

215
00:17:13,847 --> 00:17:16,385
Firstly, the wisest man in England
is insane for an hour every day.

216
00:17:17,518 --> 00:17:21,562
Secondly, intelligence and genius
are depreciated by 25%,

217
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:23,687
upon setting foot in England.

218
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:28,402
And thirdly, nothing is more
admirable, more beautiful

219
00:17:28,654 --> 00:17:31,323
more moving, than the English countryside.

220
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:33,858
Did you see any man of wit?

221
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:36,776
I saw Philip Vane who said,

222
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:38,448
excuse me, M. Marquis,

223
00:17:38,706 --> 00:17:41,457
''The tyrant's most useful idea is God."

224
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,873
You can leave that idea in England.

225
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:48,418
I'll bet, M. Profundity,

226
00:17:48,674 --> 00:17:50,334
that you don't know what
you were looking for there.

227
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:54,507
Tend more closely to your
affairs and you'll find out.

228
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:58,046
So take this medal.

229
00:17:58,976 --> 00:18:00,351
The medal, sir?

230
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:02,353
I don't deserve ...

231
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:04,438
You don't deserve the medal?

232
00:18:05,524 --> 00:18:06,639
You've got it.

233
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:10,896
Sir, this is too generous.

234
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:14,773
This medal shows you are a secretary in my house.

235
00:18:15,034 --> 00:18:17,703
I don't wish to raise you
above your proper station.

236
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:20,489
That's a mistake that's unfortunate,

237
00:18:20,748 --> 00:18:23,155
for both the protector and the protected.

238
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:25,126
You are now decorated.

239
00:18:25,753 --> 00:18:28,919
When my lawsuits begin to bore you,
or you're no longer acceptable to me,

240
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:31,000
I'll find you a good parish,

241
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:33,215
like your Father Pirard.

242
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:35,213
That's all.

243
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,513
Go and rest, my friend.

244
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,339
See you later.

245
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:52,984
Hey!

246
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:55,939
- Have a good trip?
- Great, thanks.

247
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,113
But ...

248
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:01,737
The Marquis gave me this surprise.

249
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:03,408
It's a surprise to me, too.

250
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,166
My compliments.

251
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:15,423
Well, sir, thank you.

252
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:16,424
For what?

253
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,252
The red ribbon he's just met.

254
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:23,512
He's been asking for a
medal for 18 months.

255
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:25,180
It's out of love.

256
00:19:25,437 --> 00:19:27,097
Yes, Julien is fun.

257
00:19:27,564 --> 00:19:30,565
This does not become
you, dear M. Mole.

258
00:19:34,196 --> 00:19:36,189
Indeed. I'm boring.

259
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:40,596
I admire her beauty, but I'm afraid of her mind.

260
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:52,079
Lights.

261
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:14,310
Oh, it's magical.

262
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:17,443
I arrived too early, how provincial of me.

263
00:20:17,698 --> 00:20:20,106
We'll always be, a little.

264
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:21,530
Not you, my friend.

265
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:24,111
This dress fits you a little too well.

266
00:20:24,371 --> 00:20:26,862
- In this house ...
- As for that decoration,

267
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:30,160
it doesn't suit you
at all, in my opinion.

268
00:21:16,757 --> 00:21:19,165
Oh, M. Sorel, I'm so
happy to see you.

269
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:22,836
I want him to go back to Besancon.

270
00:21:23,097 --> 00:21:23,843
Too late.

271
00:21:24,098 --> 00:21:26,589
You shouldn't have released
him into the world.

272
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:34,262
M. Sorel ...

273
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:36,980
Have you ever seen such
a wonderful ball?

274
00:21:37,236 --> 00:21:39,857
I see little. I spend my time writing.

275
00:21:42,449 --> 00:21:44,406
How wise you are, M. Sorel.

276
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:48,324
Such extravagance astonishes
you without seducing you.

277
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,779
On the contrary.

278
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,160
It doesn't astonish me
but always seduces me.

279
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:10,475
If he is to be lost then
he should do it quickly.

280
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:12,649
Then I won't have to think about him.

281
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:15,769
Lost? He'll be a bishop in seven years.

282
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:17,729
Yes ...

283
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,020
That's what I say.

284
00:22:37,296 --> 00:22:40,380
Who's with Sorel? Count Altamira?

285
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:44,298
Yes, that's him.

286
00:22:44,803 --> 00:22:47,010
He came to seek refuge in Paris.

287
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,972
If I went back to my king,

288
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:55,351
I'd be hanged in 24 hours.

289
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:56,935
And ...

290
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:00,434
Thank you.

291
00:23:03,572 --> 00:23:06,324
It's one of those moustached gentlemen,

292
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:08,817
who will take me back to the border.

293
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:11,079
The wretches!

294
00:23:11,664 --> 00:23:13,074
You're very young.

295
00:23:13,624 --> 00:23:16,660
In France, we do the cruellest things,

296
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:19,079
but without cruelty.

297
00:23:24,593 --> 00:23:28,721
A condemned man at a ball
What could be more amazing?

298
00:23:28,973 --> 00:23:31,724
His failed conspiracy was ridiculous.

299
00:23:31,976 --> 00:23:34,015
He's most interesting.

300
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:34,850
How?

301
00:23:35,104 --> 00:23:36,764
The death sentence

302
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:39,727
is the only thing that
you can't buy.

303
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,819
A title can be bought.

304
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,312
A medal can be given, like yours.

305
00:23:45,572 --> 00:23:46,568
A degree obtained.

306
00:23:46,824 --> 00:23:49,362
10 years in a garrison and
a relative in the ministry,

307
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:51,112
and you become a squadron leader.

308
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,745
As with my brother.

309
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:58,291
But the death sentence must be earned.

310
00:23:58,544 --> 00:24:01,877
Marry a criminal, then,
you'll be very happy.

311
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:04,664
Why not?

312
00:24:04,925 --> 00:24:06,384
If he was a man.

313
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:24,439
Yes ... he was in love.

314
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:27,068
- It was his weakness.
- Who?

315
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:32,526
- Danton, miss.
- But he was only a butcher.

316
00:24:33,245 --> 00:24:35,119
No, miss.

317
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:39,204
You say that because he was
ugly. You talk like a woman.

318
00:24:39,668 --> 00:24:42,918
There is more than ugliness if you
concern his soul and not his face.

319
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:46,173
You don't wear anything.

320
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:47,421
Only that beard.

321
00:25:08,822 --> 00:25:11,230
What a face! Are
you in a bad mood?

322
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:13,200
Wait until the end of the ball.

323
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:29,507
What is it?

324
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,049
Baron de Tully. An attack of apoplexy!

325
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:33,882
- My God!
- Never mind.

326
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:36,132
- Mathilde!
- Well, he's old.

327
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,307
- He's over there.
- Who?

328
00:25:43,565 --> 00:25:45,024
The one you're looking for.

329
00:25:45,275 --> 00:25:47,648
Can't a girl just look at people?

330
00:25:47,903 --> 00:25:49,397
All right, quieten down.

331
00:25:49,655 --> 00:25:52,691
We're not at the ball to be
quiet, we're here to dance.

332
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,156
- Give me that punch.
- Watch it, Mathilde.

333
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:57,119
Anger makes you ugly.

334
00:25:57,579 --> 00:25:58,778
Let it.

335
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,455
Don't lose your head
over this little priest.

336
00:26:07,047 --> 00:26:09,882
The revolution in which I was involved

337
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,795
was not a success ...

338
00:26:12,511 --> 00:26:15,631
because I refused to cut off three heads.

339
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:19,258
But could you do it now?

340
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:22,012
You're very young.

341
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,600
I'll respond to that when you've
killed a man in a duel.

342
00:26:27,318 --> 00:26:30,153
It's less ugly than sending
him to the executioner.

343
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:34,356
Me, I'd cut off three
heads to save four.

344
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,358
Or even four to save three.

345
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:39,612
Another Danton, maybe.

346
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,414
Although less ugly.

347
00:26:44,043 --> 00:26:46,830
Fear not, there's no more Danton.

348
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:50,920
What would he be today?
Not even the Crown prosecutor.

349
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:54,378
He'd have sold out to the Jesuits,
or become a government minister.

350
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:58,050
Because, finally, this ''great'' Danton
did his share of stealing.

351
00:26:58,307 --> 00:27:01,842
Napoleon also stole millions. In Italy.

352
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:04,640
Otherwise poverty would've
stopped him in his tracks.

353
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:07,769
And you?

354
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:10,812
Have you decided whether to steal

355
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,480
or sell?

356
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:17,154
Must a man who wants to
wipe out ignorance and crime,

357
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:19,402
sweep across the earth like a hurricane,

358
00:27:19,662 --> 00:27:22,069
doing evil however it happens to take place?

359
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:32,795
The best thing for me is to be
M. de la Mole's secretary.

360
00:28:24,476 --> 00:28:28,141
My father said that you want
to leave for Languedoc.

361
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:30,894
Miss ...

362
00:28:31,817 --> 00:28:35,684
Your father has a trial there.
It's helpful if I'm there too.

363
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:38,145
A trial?

364
00:28:38,991 --> 00:28:40,818
That's not the real reason.

365
00:28:42,703 --> 00:28:45,028
I'm terribly hypocritical.

366
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:47,661
It's not hypocritical if you admit it.

367
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:49,459
Don't rely on that.

368
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:53,626
It's not simple, hypocrisy.

369
00:28:53,881 --> 00:28:56,288
To my brother, you have an air of a priest.

370
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,629
I am a priest.

371
00:28:58,093 --> 00:29:01,213
You look different when we're alone.

372
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:02,551
Really?

373
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:04,925
I hadn't noticed.

374
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:08,177
Thank you for warning me.

375
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:10,513
We won't be alone together any more.

376
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:13,271
Does it scare you?

377
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:15,893
No. But I know my place.

378
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:17,481
That's why I'm leaving.

379
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:20,229
I'll ask my father for you to stay.

380
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:21,653
Do nothing.

381
00:29:22,618 --> 00:29:23,946
He would obey you.

382
00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:26,242
Don't you like me being here?

383
00:29:27,706 --> 00:29:30,114
I saw you insult M. Croisenois.

384
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:32,285
I'm a man, I disliked it.

385
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,418
For him, for you and for me.

386
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:36,960
What do you care about M. Croisenois?

387
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:39,541
Treat him as you understand him.

388
00:29:39,802 --> 00:29:42,589
- But I won't play this game.
- What game?

389
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:46,968
Exactly. I don't know which.

390
00:29:48,811 --> 00:29:50,934
In the end, it's too complicated.

391
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,685
You show me friendship.
You may be sincere,

392
00:29:57,945 --> 00:29:59,736
or want to make me appear ridiculous

393
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:02,195
along with your brother or M. Croisenois.

394
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:05,193
Nothing proves otherwise to me.

395
00:30:06,036 --> 00:30:08,159
I'm not comfortable here.

396
00:30:08,414 --> 00:30:10,905
So I've asked to get away for a while.

397
00:30:13,585 --> 00:30:16,670
You again? Don't stop working.

398
00:30:16,922 --> 00:30:17,918
That would be difficult.

399
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:21,210
- Are you coming to the opera tonight?
- It's April 30!

400
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:22,798
That's right.

401
00:30:24,054 --> 00:30:25,383
You'll understand.

402
00:30:26,432 --> 00:30:28,175
April 30, 1574,

403
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:31,518
our ancestor Boniface
de la Mole was beheaded.

404
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,478
It's in the third volume of Moreri.

405
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:37,775
Ingrained in the head
of a romantic young girl.

406
00:30:38,277 --> 00:30:43,318
Each year, my dear girl goes in
mourning for the anniversary.

407
00:30:43,574 --> 00:30:45,483
On this day she thinks
of herself as a widow.

408
00:30:46,201 --> 00:30:49,950
Boniface de la Mole was the lover
of Marguerite de Navarre.

409
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:53,409
My daughter is called Mathilde-Marguerite.

410
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,707
She believes she's inherited bereavements,

411
00:30:56,128 --> 00:30:57,587
of her ancestors.

412
00:30:58,714 --> 00:30:59,959
However, Marguerite de Navarre

413
00:31:00,215 --> 00:31:03,750
dared to ask the executioner for
her lover's decapitated head.

414
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:06,169
and bore it away for burial.

415
00:31:06,597 --> 00:31:08,755
This tale was made to
please my daughter.

416
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:13,263
What woman today would touch the
decapitated head of her lover?

417
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:15,976
None. Thank God.

418
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:21,694
It's all too heavy for a young girl.

419
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:38,038
So, is the marriage contract ready?

420
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:40,038
I ... here, Marquis.

421
00:31:42,132 --> 00:31:45,003
M. Croisenois will have no complaints.

422
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,926
He wanted my land,
Villequier, I gave it.

423
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:51,092
''I must speak to you tonight."

424
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:55,134
''At midnight, take the gardener's
ladder and come to my window."

425
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:57,768
''There will a beautiful full moon ...''

426
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,226
Two Ls in "Villequier".

427
00:32:03,612 --> 00:32:05,652
Watch the spelling, my friend.

428
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:12,321
She's insane.

429
00:32:13,706 --> 00:32:16,410
She wants me to climb a
ladder to the second floor?

430
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:20,246
In full moonlight?

431
00:32:21,213 --> 00:32:23,371
How dashing I'll look on my ladder.

432
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:27,800
Everyone will have time to see me,

433
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:30,089
even from the neighbouring houses.

434
00:32:31,932 --> 00:32:33,676
What is her purpose?

435
00:32:37,062 --> 00:32:38,556
To ridicule me?

436
00:32:39,565 --> 00:32:40,727
Get me killed?

437
00:32:50,492 --> 00:32:52,284
I'm not going to answer.

438
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,662
But if she's acting in good faith ...

439
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:07,127
Then in her eyes I'd be playing
the role of a perfect coward.

440
00:33:07,926 --> 00:33:12,470
In this case, if I don't go,
I'd always hate myself for it.

441
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:14,514
Oh, not for her.

442
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:16,767
There are so many other women.

443
00:33:17,019 --> 00:33:19,344
But there's only one honour.

444
00:33:21,523 --> 00:33:24,524
"This is getting serious, my boy."

445
00:33:24,777 --> 00:33:26,235
"It's all about honour.''

446
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,397
What poor devil thrown so far down,

447
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:33,568
ever gets an opportunity like this?

448
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,950
I'll do well with other women,

449
00:33:36,955 --> 00:33:38,331
but never one so high up.

450
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,121
That said, I'll do it.
Besides, she's pretty.

451
00:33:46,465 --> 00:33:48,671
You can never be too careful.

452
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:52,262
I'll send a copy of the note,

453
00:33:52,972 --> 00:33:54,252
to a safe place.

454
00:33:55,057 --> 00:33:57,014
To be opened in case of "accident",

455
00:33:59,311 --> 00:34:01,885
if I'm attacked in her room,

456
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:07,067
or if a servant pulls me down
while I'm climbing the ladder.

457
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:10,939
What a lovely scandal.

458
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:13,314
I can tell you.

459
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:19,530
You're talking out loud, you idiot.

460
00:34:27,172 --> 00:34:28,501
And her brother?

461
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,291
I haven't come to the fencing lesson.

462
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:34,216
That swashbuckler!

463
00:34:35,264 --> 00:34:37,636
Maybe he'll kill me tonight.

464
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:40,722
Should I let this hour
pass or should I go?

465
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:42,344
Off we go!

466
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:44,929
To arms!

467
00:34:57,828 --> 00:34:59,785
I thought you'd forgotten me.

468
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:00,869
Forgotten?

469
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,493
I think only of you.

470
00:36:02,017 --> 00:36:03,132
Sorry.

471
00:36:05,437 --> 00:36:06,600
It's all right.

472
00:36:15,364 --> 00:36:18,863
That looks like a rehearsal
of a duel to the death.

473
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:39,924
''That's when the drums of
the hideous Santerre,"

474
00:36:40,347 --> 00:36:42,969
"smothered the voice of the
unfortunate Louis XVI.''

475
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,182
It takes a long time,

476
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:52,771
for Madame de Marquise to fall asleep.

477
00:39:16,128 --> 00:39:19,045
I've been watching you. You hesitated.

478
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:25,376
Don't touch me.

479
00:39:25,638 --> 00:39:28,045
What's this?

480
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,766
I have all kinds of weapons.

481
00:39:35,522 --> 00:39:38,060
Well ... we have to get rid of the ladder.

482
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,396
I've got just the thing.

483
00:40:24,697 --> 00:40:28,362
What will my mother think
seeing her crushed flowers?

484
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:33,703
Now drop the rope.

485
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:45,079
How am I going to get out?

486
00:40:46,385 --> 00:40:47,215
There.

487
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:50,839
Your mother's room?

488
00:40:51,098 --> 00:40:51,845
Yes.

489
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:55,302
What if she calls for help?
A servant might shoot me.

490
00:40:55,561 --> 00:40:56,391
Yes.

491
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,305
Fine.

492
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,488
In any case, there won't
be any servants in there.

493
00:41:14,288 --> 00:41:16,079
There could be one under your bed.

494
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:19,449
Maybe. Have a look.

495
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:26,590
Very well.

496
00:41:27,676 --> 00:41:28,707
I'll check.

497
00:41:48,364 --> 00:41:50,522
You thought it was an ambush?

498
00:41:50,783 --> 00:41:54,401
Yes. There's no point in lying.

499
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:57,069
At dinner I tried to see,

500
00:41:57,331 --> 00:41:59,240
who might do away with me.

501
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:01,501
You were very pale.

502
00:42:02,795 --> 00:42:06,377
In your pallor I read the
sentence of your family.

503
00:42:06,632 --> 00:42:08,043
Your death warrant?

504
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:11,128
And you were afraid?

505
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,388
I was really afraid.

506
00:42:14,974 --> 00:42:16,717
Is that what you wanted?

507
00:42:16,976 --> 00:42:18,055
And you ...

508
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,184
You came here anyway?

509
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:30,435
You have a man's heart, Julien.

510
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:55,717
Mathilde!

511
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:01,300
Mathilde!

512
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,515
Mathilde!

513
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,026
Mathilde!

514
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,197
There's no-one else here.

515
00:43:54,657 --> 00:43:55,855
Mathilde!

516
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:02,535
Mathilde!

517
00:44:03,707 --> 00:44:05,499
Don't you like me anymore?

518
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:11,420
I'm appalled that I gave myself
to the first one to come along.

519
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:14,800
The first one to come along?

520
00:44:35,698 --> 00:44:37,489
I don't love you enough,

521
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:40,315
to have my head cut off for you.

522
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:21,323
I promise not to talk to you again.

523
00:45:51,023 --> 00:45:52,186
What's this ...

524
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,104
Have you lost your head?

525
00:46:12,544 --> 00:46:17,502
Punirmi Devo, Devo punirmi,
(I must be punished)

526
00:46:17,758 --> 00:46:21,672
Se troppo amai, Devo punirmi,
(I love him so much)

527
00:46:23,389 --> 00:46:27,682
Se troppo amai, amai is troppo,

528
00:46:28,936 --> 00:46:33,977
Se troppo amai, Devo punirmi,

529
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:38,228
Devo punirmi,

530
00:46:38,654 --> 00:46:44,657
Devo punirmi, Se troppo amai, Devo punirmi,

531
00:46:45,452 --> 00:46:49,117
Se troppo amai, amai is troppo,

532
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,909
Se troppo amai, Devo punirmi.

533
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,169
She doesn't love me.

534
00:47:05,264 --> 00:47:08,265
Why have I put myself in this position?

535
00:47:09,977 --> 00:47:11,886
Yes, I love her.

536
00:47:13,647 --> 00:47:15,806
I could for my whole life.

537
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:18,687
Me? A lifetime?

538
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:20,399
And her?

539
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:24,440
One night. It's not fair.

540
00:47:25,617 --> 00:47:27,195
Mathilde ...

541
00:47:37,963 --> 00:47:39,292
She's right.

542
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:43,623
I have too little credit to please her.

543
00:47:44,136 --> 00:47:47,339
All in all, I'm a very dull, common person.

544
00:47:48,807 --> 00:47:51,049
It's decided then, I'll kill myself.

545
00:47:53,812 --> 00:47:57,146
But death would make her
despise me even more.

546
00:48:02,154 --> 00:48:02,936
No ...

547
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:06,779
I'll go up the ladder again,
if only for a moment.

548
00:48:08,327 --> 00:48:11,778
She'll be furious, pour scorn
on me, but who cares?

549
00:48:12,706 --> 00:48:15,197
I'll give her a kiss. One last kiss.

550
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,164
Then I'll go home and kill myself.

551
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,016
What's the meaning of all this?

552
00:48:34,269 --> 00:48:38,101
I love him too much! I must be punished!

553
00:48:38,357 --> 00:48:39,637
Who do you love?

554
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:41,312
It's the words of the song, mama.

555
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:43,561
Love him quietly, then.

556
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:44,900
I've got a fever.

557
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,029
The harpsichord's not going to help.

558
00:48:47,282 --> 00:48:50,616
Has anyone ever wanted to kill you?

559
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:53,574
You don't know what
it means to be loved.

560
00:49:06,093 --> 00:49:10,719
Punirmi Devo, Devo punirmi,

561
00:49:10,973 --> 00:49:14,805
Se troppo amai, Devo punirmi,

562
00:49:18,981 --> 00:49:24,022
Punirmi Devo, Devo punirmi,

563
00:49:24,278 --> 00:49:26,733
Se troppo amai.

564
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:36,089
It's you?

565
00:50:45,693 --> 00:50:48,266
You didn't think of this, Julien.

566
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:52,232
Did you come to punish me
for my atrocious pride?

567
00:50:54,535 --> 00:50:55,946
Scare her.

568
00:50:56,203 --> 00:50:59,572
The enemy won't obey me
unless they're afraid of me.

569
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,249
Don't show her your love, Julien.

570
00:51:07,256 --> 00:51:09,332
You're my master.

571
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:11,880
I'm your slave.

572
00:51:13,095 --> 00:51:15,882
Should I get down on my
knees and beg forgiveness,

573
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,049
for having revolted against you?

574
00:51:25,024 --> 00:51:26,138
Careful, now.

575
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,816
Still be a bit mean to her.

576
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:34,939
A little.

577
00:51:35,868 --> 00:51:37,113
Not too much.

578
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:54,972
With what can a young girl gamble? With her
most precious possession, her reputation...

579
00:52:02,102 --> 00:52:04,474
Miss! Mass 6 pm!

580
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,055
I'm coming!

581
00:52:11,779 --> 00:52:14,352
I don't need you this morning.

582
00:52:22,373 --> 00:52:24,246
Forget it, I can do it.

583
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,531
Why?

584
00:52:25,793 --> 00:52:28,414
It's only the servants who are annoying.

585
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:31,833
And since you do without
them because of me...

586
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:37,130
You're my master.

587
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:38,930
Even when you serve me.

588
00:52:39,181 --> 00:52:41,387
- Don't talk nonsense.
- Why?

589
00:52:41,642 --> 00:52:43,136
You're not my master?

590
00:52:47,982 --> 00:52:50,140
Are you sure you'll still
love me in eight days?

591
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:57,563
You want guarantees?
You have the right.

592
00:52:58,075 --> 00:52:59,403
Go away and leave me.

593
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,993
I'll be dishonoured forever.
That's a guarantee.

594
00:53:03,247 --> 00:53:04,622
You'd do it.

595
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:07,499
You're not afraid of scandal.

596
00:53:08,377 --> 00:53:10,666
But meanwhile, would you still love me?

597
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:14,456
It's not your position to put up obstacles.

598
00:53:14,883 --> 00:53:16,876
It's your character.

599
00:53:17,136 --> 00:53:19,461
- And if I give you a guarantee?
- A guarantee?

600
00:53:19,722 --> 00:53:21,097
A true pledge.

601
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:24,639
Wait ...

602
00:53:26,812 --> 00:53:27,808
You'll see ...

603
00:53:29,231 --> 00:53:31,936
A lock of hair? That's just a souvenir.

604
00:53:32,192 --> 00:53:33,603
Not just a lock.

605
00:53:34,028 --> 00:53:37,646
I'll cut my hair myself,
as if I were entering Mt. Carmel.

606
00:53:37,906 --> 00:53:39,365
I'm dedicated to you.

607
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:40,815
Stop it, are you crazy?

608
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:43,032
You lunatic!

609
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:45,031
Everyone will see.

610
00:53:46,915 --> 00:53:48,991
Yes, everyone will see.

611
00:53:50,294 --> 00:53:51,836
Do you want me to love you?

612
00:53:52,254 --> 00:53:53,452
Yes or no?

613
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:56,415
Yes.

614
00:54:18,614 --> 00:54:22,825
This is wonderful, Julien.
There's no turning back now.

615
00:54:23,452 --> 00:54:24,650
Fine.

616
00:54:25,537 --> 00:54:26,818
Your father will drive me out.

617
00:54:27,247 --> 00:54:28,528
That's right.

618
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:30,748
Then we'll go out together,

619
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:33,955
through the front door at noon.

620
00:54:34,421 --> 00:54:35,999
Yes, Mathilde.

621
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,878
You'll accept a future so inferior?

622
00:54:41,303 --> 00:54:42,252
Inferior?

623
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:45,593
But Julien, when there's a revolution...

624
00:54:45,933 --> 00:54:47,095
There won't be.

625
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,888
Well...he won't throw us out.

626
00:54:55,985 --> 00:54:59,650
I have weapons against
my father that you don't.

627
00:55:05,077 --> 00:55:06,240
Disgrace ...

628
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:10,789
That's a very powerful weapon
in the hands of a girl.

629
00:55:15,504 --> 00:55:18,505
I'll use it well.

630
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:22,336
Have I disgraced you?

631
00:55:25,848 --> 00:55:26,713
Yes.

632
00:55:32,479 --> 00:55:35,149
From top to bottom.

633
00:55:51,665 --> 00:55:53,788
What happened to your hair?

634
00:55:54,418 --> 00:55:56,245
You'll get used to it.

635
00:55:56,503 --> 00:55:58,745
I know, but for the 6am mass...

636
00:56:02,634 --> 00:56:04,342
Come on, hurry.

637
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:00,608
Mathilde!

638
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,523
Here!

639
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:31,549
Lovable!

640
00:57:32,266 --> 00:57:33,380
Lovable!

641
00:57:34,018 --> 00:57:37,802
The day you found her lovable
you should have fled.

642
00:57:38,063 --> 00:57:40,352
I behaved badly.

643
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:43,940
A monster.

644
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:45,737
Do you hear? A monster.

645
00:57:45,988 --> 00:57:47,233
You are a monster.

646
00:57:47,489 --> 00:57:48,070
No, sir.

647
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:51,575
I've served you well and
you've treated me well.

648
00:57:51,827 --> 00:57:53,238
But I'm young,

649
00:57:53,662 --> 00:57:55,287
and I'm not an angel.

650
00:57:56,707 --> 00:57:57,870
An angel!

651
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:06,047
Yet you're not a bad boy either.

652
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:07,165
No, sir.

653
00:58:07,593 --> 00:58:08,838
And you know we...

654
00:58:09,261 --> 00:58:10,292
No ...

655
00:58:11,138 --> 00:58:12,716
What? What is it?

656
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:15,053
You, shut up.

657
00:58:15,601 --> 00:58:18,174
You talk all the time. Go away.

658
00:58:18,812 --> 00:58:19,642
No, stay.

659
00:58:20,522 --> 00:58:23,476
This concerns you as much
as me. And even more.

660
00:58:23,901 --> 00:58:24,932
As for you ...

661
00:58:25,194 --> 00:58:27,566
- You can kill me.
- Fine by me.

662
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,605
Or get a servant to shoot me.

663
00:58:30,866 --> 00:58:33,737
Get you killed, get you killed - pfff!

664
00:58:42,836 --> 00:58:45,162
I'll write that I committed suicide.

665
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,339
Then everything will be fine.

666
00:58:48,467 --> 00:58:51,254
How romantic! You're both mad.

667
00:58:51,512 --> 00:58:54,003
Not me. I don't want him to die.

668
00:58:54,848 --> 00:58:57,600
I can duel with Count Norbert.

669
00:58:57,893 --> 00:59:00,016
I won't fire upon your son.

670
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,808
If Julien is killed, I'll die too.

671
00:59:03,065 --> 00:59:04,263
And it'll be your fault!

672
00:59:04,525 --> 00:59:06,233
I didn't say anything, it was him!

673
00:59:06,485 --> 00:59:08,276
But I'll be in mourning first.

674
00:59:08,529 --> 00:59:10,356
This is a mania.

675
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:12,773
Everyone will know I'm Madame Sorel.

676
00:59:13,033 --> 00:59:14,231
Madame Sorel!

677
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,449
A smart girl, noble ...

678
00:59:17,705 --> 00:59:20,077
- Beautiful.
- Don't make me laugh.

679
00:59:20,749 --> 00:59:21,947
You're not going to be a duchess.

680
00:59:22,209 --> 00:59:25,792
- It's impossible.
- What's impossible now?

681
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:29,249
Can we talk about this reasonably?

682
00:59:29,508 --> 00:59:31,964
We're both sensible adults.

683
00:59:32,386 --> 00:59:35,340
Until recently, yes.  But now...

684
00:59:35,764 --> 00:59:39,679
You will agree with me: an
estrangement is imperative.

685
00:59:39,935 --> 00:59:40,717
Agreed.

686
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:42,888
- On certain conditions.
- No.

687
00:59:43,814 --> 00:59:45,356
I'll make him a lieutenant,

688
00:59:45,774 --> 00:59:47,566
- and send him to the provinces.
- Bravo.

689
00:59:47,985 --> 00:59:49,313
I love the province.

690
00:59:50,404 --> 00:59:52,231
I wasn't talking about you!

691
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:56,238
Did my father imagine that I would
be separated from my husband?

692
00:59:56,535 --> 00:59:58,077
Your husband?

693
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,361
Never!

694
01:00:01,373 --> 01:00:04,160
You hear me? You will
not have my daughter.

695
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:06,748
He already has.

696
01:00:07,296 --> 01:00:08,755
Don't be so indecent!

697
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:12,548
This gentleman should be
made to forget a little, first.

698
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:15,090
I should know nothing about this.

699
01:00:15,346 --> 01:00:18,015
And neither should you.
Not even when he leaves.

700
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:19,678
The seminary, yes.

701
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:22,511
But before the seminary?

702
01:00:24,521 --> 01:00:28,796
The truth, the harsh truth!

703
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:04,185
You have the letter?

704
01:01:38,512 --> 01:01:40,255
This letter isn't suitable.

705
01:01:41,015 --> 01:01:43,387
It's not what had been understood.

706
01:01:44,518 --> 01:01:47,187
My husband dictated it
almost word for word.

707
01:01:47,438 --> 01:01:50,059
Unfortunate. All the worse.

708
01:01:50,566 --> 01:01:54,017
In agreeing to write it,
you've still deceived him.

709
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:57,694
Sin is still rooted in your soul.

710
01:02:01,452 --> 01:02:05,401
I know somewhere quiet to talk. Come.

711
01:02:30,731 --> 01:02:31,894
Sit.

712
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:51,614
Take this pen.

713
01:02:56,882 --> 01:02:59,088
Here's what you write:

714
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:05,672
''M. Marquis de la Mole ..."

715
01:03:10,813 --> 01:03:12,390
''My duty,"

716
01:03:13,524 --> 01:03:15,481
''to the sacred cause,"

717
01:03:16,819 --> 01:03:20,152
''of religion and morality,"

718
01:03:21,824 --> 01:03:23,282
"obliges me,''

719
01:03:24,618 --> 01:03:27,192
"to proceed with the painful step,''

720
01:03:27,997 --> 01:03:31,531
"I am about to take in writing to you"

721
01:03:37,089 --> 01:03:38,832
"M. Julien Sorel ...''

722
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:50,760
I can't write his name.

723
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:52,348
Write.

724
01:03:56,775 --> 01:04:01,105
The letter won't be legible
if you cry on it.

725
01:04:03,449 --> 01:04:05,690
Let's finish here, I beg you.

726
01:04:07,661 --> 01:04:09,405
''Mr. Julien Sorel..."

727
01:04:12,124 --> 01:04:17,747
''Of whom you ask me the whole truth,"

728
01:04:22,468 --> 01:04:24,507
"behaved in my house,"

729
01:04:27,389 --> 01:04:30,639
"in a most reprehensible way."

730
01:04:34,855 --> 01:04:36,053
There ...

731
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:37,520
Good ...

732
01:04:38,651 --> 01:04:41,106
Is that comfortable, Lieutenant?

733
01:04:43,906 --> 01:04:45,186
Wonderfully.

734
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:47,529
One moment.

735
01:04:52,581 --> 01:04:53,992
Turn around a bit.

736
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,245
It doesn't stand out.

737
01:04:58,045 --> 01:04:59,041
Pity.

738
01:05:00,422 --> 01:05:01,881
Mathilde was right.

739
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:04,790
The good Marquis can't live without her,

740
01:05:05,052 --> 01:05:06,961
nor she without me.

741
01:05:07,763 --> 01:05:08,759
So there you are.

742
01:05:09,014 --> 01:05:11,588
Lieutenant Julien Sorel of the Vernaye.

743
01:05:12,393 --> 01:05:16,521
From Vernaye. And
Madam was born in La Mole.

744
01:05:17,523 --> 01:05:19,183
Take a few steps, sir.

745
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:31,650
Wait for me!

746
01:05:34,832 --> 01:05:36,623
I don't see anything wrong with it.

747
01:05:38,293 --> 01:05:40,203
She was wonderful.

748
01:05:43,257 --> 01:05:45,415
And me too, after all.

749
01:05:48,804 --> 01:05:51,591
I was loved by this monster of pride.

750
01:05:57,396 --> 01:05:58,676
I'll get it.

751
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:06,278
My story is finished.

752
01:06:06,530 --> 01:06:08,653
And the credit is mine alone.

753
01:06:29,345 --> 01:06:31,005
All is lost!

754
01:06:31,263 --> 01:06:34,714
That horrible woman whose
children you taught ...

755
01:06:34,975 --> 01:06:36,090
Read it!

756
01:06:37,144 --> 01:06:40,311
''... sacred cause
of religion and morality,"

757
01:06:40,564 --> 01:06:43,980
"to proceed with the painful step I
am about to take in writing to you..."

758
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:47,271
You told my father her name!

759
01:06:47,529 --> 01:06:48,727
Quiet!

760
01:06:50,366 --> 01:06:53,070
I didn't know she still loved me.

761
01:06:55,371 --> 01:06:58,241
''... of whom you asked me the whole truth,"

762
01:06:58,499 --> 01:07:01,500
"..behaved in a most reprehensible way..."

763
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:05,329
" and more that I cannot say ...''

764
01:07:07,257 --> 01:07:09,630
''An infallible law,"

765
01:07:09,885 --> 01:07:12,803
"now orders me to do
harm to my neighbour,"

766
01:07:13,055 --> 01:07:15,380
"in order to prevent an
even bigger disgrace."

767
01:07:15,641 --> 01:07:20,980
''I might have thought it proper
to hide some of the truth,"

768
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:24,681
"Prudence might so desire,
as might, also, religion."

769
01:07:25,317 --> 01:07:29,149
''It's a painful part of my
duty to add that I believe,"

770
01:07:29,571 --> 01:07:33,865
"that M. Julien Sorel has
no religious beliefs,"

771
01:07:35,577 --> 01:07:38,697
"and if he enters in a Christian family,"

772
01:07:39,415 --> 01:07:42,831
"He will cause scandal and disorder there."

773
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,002
"Poor and voraciously greedy,''

774
01:07:45,254 --> 01:07:48,705
"by means of the most consummate hypocrisy,"

775
01:07:49,341 --> 01:07:53,469
"and the seduction of a
weak and unhappy woman,"

776
01:07:54,096 --> 01:07:57,180
"he has sought position,"

777
01:07:57,433 --> 01:08:00,137
"and reputation."

778
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,770
''He cloaks himself with a
pretense of unselfishness,"

779
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,523
''but he has no other purpose,"

780
01:08:09,194 --> 01:08:14,152
"than to make use of the master
of the house and his fortune."

781
01:08:16,327 --> 01:08:18,818
''He leaves behind him misery,"

782
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,752
"and eternal regret.''

783
01:11:15,297 --> 01:11:16,839
The hearing is open.

784
01:11:37,111 --> 01:11:38,937
No, we're not getting out.

785
01:11:39,196 --> 01:11:40,394
We'll wait here.

786
01:11:48,664 --> 01:11:49,944
What time is it?

787
01:11:50,207 --> 01:11:51,998
We're having a bet, you want in?

788
01:11:52,251 --> 01:11:53,282
Bet? For what?

789
01:11:53,544 --> 01:11:55,869
That he'll be sentenced to death.

790
01:11:56,505 --> 01:11:57,418
I don't bet.

791
01:12:09,518 --> 01:12:10,716
I won!

792
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:12,052
I won!

793
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:36,752
Very well judged.

794
01:12:37,004 --> 01:12:38,961
I cried when he spoke.

795
01:12:39,214 --> 01:12:40,792
The lawyer made me cry.

796
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:42,758
- How old is he?
- 23.

797
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:44,089
He's so handsome.

798
01:12:44,345 --> 01:12:45,720
I'm starving.

799
01:12:45,971 --> 01:12:47,002
It's sad.

800
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:48,462
We need to set an example.

801
01:12:49,808 --> 01:12:51,600
Let's go out, we need to know.

802
01:12:51,852 --> 01:12:55,186
It's only to be expected,
with such an attitude.

803
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:58,144
He wanted to die, he
got what he wanted.

804
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,645
It's not possible!

805
01:12:59,902 --> 01:13:02,274
They can't kill him, he only wounded me.

806
01:13:02,946 --> 01:13:04,405
Let's go, quickly!

807
01:13:08,327 --> 01:13:11,910
If you go, you'll never
see your children again.

808
01:13:15,834 --> 01:13:17,910
There's nothing more to do.

809
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:19,285
It's over.

810
01:13:20,631 --> 01:13:22,837
I don't want it to be over.

811
01:13:23,634 --> 01:13:26,421
Xavier, Adolphe, look!

812
01:13:27,096 --> 01:13:29,551
Look how your mother abandons us.

813
01:13:36,021 --> 01:13:38,429
Louise! Come back!

814
01:13:42,945 --> 01:13:44,059
No.

815
01:13:46,991 --> 01:13:47,821
Go!

816
01:14:17,613 --> 01:14:22,426
If God existed, I would fall at his feet,
"I have deserved death," I would say to him,

817
01:14:22,426 --> 01:14:26,655
"but great God, good God, indulgent God,
give me back the one I love!"

818
01:14:53,974 --> 01:14:56,346
They told me that tomorrow I can visit.

819
01:14:56,602 --> 01:14:58,559
Well ... we'll see!

820
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:02,686
It's cruel to deny me one day,

821
01:15:03,817 --> 01:15:06,059
when he has so little life left.

822
01:15:06,487 --> 01:15:08,812
Don't worry, madame.

823
01:15:09,782 --> 01:15:11,655
As long as there is life ...

824
01:15:13,827 --> 01:15:15,903
Will you take him his food?

825
01:15:16,163 --> 01:15:18,156
There's a priest with him now.

826
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:24,702
This is his.

827
01:15:26,965 --> 01:15:28,709
He came for his pardon.

828
01:15:28,967 --> 01:15:31,044
His pardon? What pardon?

829
01:15:31,303 --> 01:15:33,130
When I say his pardon...

830
01:15:33,389 --> 01:15:35,796
He should have been reasonable.

831
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:42,898
You know he refused the chaplain?

832
01:15:43,148 --> 01:15:44,014
A seminarian!

833
01:15:45,943 --> 01:15:49,941
He must return to the bosom of
the Church, if he wants pardon.

834
01:15:50,364 --> 01:15:52,522
The priest is explaining it to him, upstairs.

835
01:15:53,283 --> 01:15:54,197
Then ...

836
01:15:54,451 --> 01:15:57,369
When he publicly confesses,

837
01:15:57,621 --> 01:15:59,910
and his solemnity is known,

838
01:16:00,916 --> 01:16:03,241
the bishop, who has some influence,

839
01:16:03,877 --> 01:16:07,044
will do what it takes to
prevent the guillotine.

840
01:16:07,297 --> 01:16:10,666
A pardon, Madame. It's earned.

841
01:16:16,765 --> 01:16:18,557
That's the priest coming back.

842
01:16:22,771 --> 01:16:23,471
So?

843
01:16:27,151 --> 01:16:28,182
Nothing.

844
01:16:29,361 --> 01:16:30,737
He said,

845
01:16:31,405 --> 01:16:35,948
"I will not return within
four steps of the Church."

846
01:16:37,703 --> 01:16:39,363
He told me again,

847
01:16:40,748 --> 01:16:45,575
"If I despise myself, what is left for me?"

848
01:16:45,836 --> 01:16:48,505
Then he's lost?

849
01:16:52,343 --> 01:16:55,546
He loses his body, which is little.

850
01:16:55,971 --> 01:16:58,296
And his soul, which is everything.

851
01:16:59,016 --> 01:17:00,344
Ah, madam.

852
01:17:01,018 --> 01:17:03,888
Where is the little Julien I gave to you?

853
01:17:04,146 --> 01:17:07,182
Help me see him, I can stop this.

854
01:17:07,441 --> 01:17:11,308
A soul that refuses the good
Lord will not fall back into sin.

855
01:17:11,862 --> 01:17:14,567
What if I could get what
he refused from you?

856
01:17:16,241 --> 01:17:18,234
But doubtless he hates me.

857
01:17:19,745 --> 01:17:22,283
He has the right after my horrible letter.

858
01:17:22,539 --> 01:17:24,164
Horrible, indeed.

859
01:17:24,416 --> 01:17:27,785
Does he know that my
confessor dictated it to me?

860
01:17:28,921 --> 01:17:31,590
And the jealousy
that was in your heart,

861
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,667
did that count for anything?

862
01:17:35,636 --> 01:17:37,011
Jealousy?

863
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:43,177
Ah, yes, I was jealous.

864
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:47,762
Why shouldn't I die in the church,

865
01:17:48,023 --> 01:17:50,182
because I can't do anything for him?

866
01:17:51,193 --> 01:17:53,316
Is that your repentance?

867
01:17:55,114 --> 01:17:56,905
I have no other.

868
01:17:59,952 --> 01:18:03,996
I deserve death because I lost Julien.

869
01:18:08,377 --> 01:18:11,164
You'll pay when the time comes, Madame.

870
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:17,552
He must be saved.

871
01:18:17,803 --> 01:18:18,918
Please listen.

872
01:18:19,722 --> 01:18:22,426
You're his conscience, but
there's nothing more there.

873
01:18:22,683 --> 01:18:25,304
I'm his sin, let me try it.

874
01:18:25,561 --> 01:18:28,016
Precisely because I am his sin.

875
01:18:37,698 --> 01:18:40,271
Let Madame see Sorel.

876
01:18:40,701 --> 01:18:43,868
I can't, she doesn't have a pass.

877
01:18:44,121 --> 01:18:45,663
I'll take responsibility.

878
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:48,288
All right.

879
01:18:50,669 --> 01:18:53,540
Go, madam. All means are good.

880
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:25,445
No ... I think I'll wait.

881
01:20:25,097 --> 01:20:26,639
Don't wake him.

882
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:28,930
Gently.

883
01:21:28,952 --> 01:21:32,037
Is that you? Is it you?

884
01:21:32,289 --> 01:21:34,994
I'll see you again before I die.

885
01:21:50,724 --> 01:21:54,093
In 13 years, I've never found a thing.

886
01:21:55,688 --> 01:21:58,357
But it's the rule, and it must be done.

887
01:22:25,634 --> 01:22:26,665
The black man.

888
01:22:27,761 --> 01:22:29,968
They always chant, those animals.

889
01:22:30,389 --> 01:22:38,219
It is forever ...

890
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:42,680
Explain to me.

891
01:22:44,236 --> 01:22:46,063
I still believe I'm pious.

892
01:22:47,239 --> 01:22:49,944
I know I've fallen back into my sin.

893
01:22:52,077 --> 01:22:53,571
But when I see you,

894
01:22:53,829 --> 01:22:56,035
all my guilt disappears.

895
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:59,166
All I am is my love for you.

896
01:23:00,836 --> 01:23:02,793
Though the word love isn't enough.

897
01:23:04,381 --> 01:23:05,959
I feel for you,

898
01:23:07,343 --> 01:23:10,012
what I should feel for God.

899
01:23:11,138 --> 01:23:12,383
Respect,

900
01:23:13,766 --> 01:23:14,928
love,

901
01:23:15,976 --> 01:23:17,305
obedience.

902
01:23:19,188 --> 01:23:20,646
You could say to me:

903
01:23:21,482 --> 01:23:23,973
"Strike down the jailer with a knife."

904
01:23:25,611 --> 01:23:27,485
I'd have killed him before I
even knew I was doing it.

905
01:23:28,864 --> 01:23:30,062
Now,

906
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:34,484
I think that to save your life,

907
01:23:35,746 --> 01:23:39,115
I'd give mine for yours,
a thousand times over.

908
01:23:40,668 --> 01:23:41,866
You say to me,

909
01:23:42,461 --> 01:23:43,872
''Let me die."

910
01:23:44,129 --> 01:23:46,288
''Don't ask me to appeal.''

911
01:23:48,217 --> 01:23:50,256
And I don't ask.

912
01:23:51,762 --> 01:23:53,387
I say to myself, "It is well,"

913
01:23:55,182 --> 01:23:56,510
"He is going to die."

914
01:23:57,559 --> 01:23:59,054
''It is good.''

915
01:24:00,562 --> 01:24:04,062
Promise me you'll ask for nothing.

916
01:24:05,275 --> 01:24:06,770
Even to yourself.

917
01:24:07,194 --> 01:24:08,819
No. Nothing ...

918
01:24:19,415 --> 01:24:20,957
You know, Julien,

919
01:24:22,334 --> 01:24:24,576
I won't live without you.

920
01:24:28,549 --> 01:24:31,384
I'm not asking, I'm ordering you.

921
01:24:31,802 --> 01:24:35,467
Not to end your life
by poison, or knife,

922
01:24:35,889 --> 01:24:38,297
or any other way.

923
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,556
Do you swear?

924
01:24:43,731 --> 01:24:46,685
And if we we were to die right now?

925
01:24:48,861 --> 01:24:49,940
Dying?

926
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:52,607
But you're not serious!

927
01:24:52,865 --> 01:24:55,023
There is no question of dying.

928
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:59,281
After another month they
still won't have done anything.

929
01:25:00,789 --> 01:25:02,165
You'll be here ...

930
01:25:03,292 --> 01:25:04,667
I'll be here ...

931
01:25:06,962 --> 01:25:08,077
One month ...

932
01:25:09,757 --> 01:25:11,833
we'll spend it together,

933
01:25:12,885 --> 01:25:15,173
in such a delicious manner.

934
01:25:16,764 --> 01:25:19,337
I'll never have been so happy.

935
01:25:20,059 --> 01:25:22,300
Never been happier?

936
01:25:22,561 --> 01:25:23,724
Never.

937
01:25:24,647 --> 01:25:26,853
I'm speaking to you as
I speak to myself.

938
01:25:30,152 --> 01:25:31,480
One month ...

939
01:25:33,572 --> 01:25:35,280
That's a lot of days.

940
01:25:36,325 --> 01:25:37,949
Many hours.

941
01:25:39,953 --> 01:25:41,578
Be happy,

942
01:25:42,706 --> 01:25:46,206
during this wonderful
piece of life that remains.

943
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:48,618
Others think I'm dead.

944
01:25:50,506 --> 01:25:53,507
You and I know that's not true.

945
01:25:54,677 --> 01:25:57,214
No more dishonour for you,

946
01:25:57,471 --> 01:25:59,843
no condemnation to death for me.

947
01:26:00,516 --> 01:26:02,140
There's nothing more than love.

948
01:26:03,894 --> 01:26:07,762
No avail to God or man.

949
01:26:09,525 --> 01:26:11,767
Nothing more than us.

950
01:27:37,636 --> 01:27:40,489
Madame de Renal was faithful to her promise.

951
01:27:40,564 --> 01:27:45,233
She did not try in any
way to shorten her life.

952
01:27:45,233 --> 01:27:50,734
But three days after Julien, she
also died, embracing her children.
