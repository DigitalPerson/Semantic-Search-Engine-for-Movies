2
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,031
What is this having-a-picnic shit in my car?

3
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:59,699
Please, man, I'm not getting my sex at home.

4
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:01,537
Don't deny me this.

5
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:04,043
You sleep with a beautiful woman every night.

6
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:06,046
I'm married. That's what married means.

7
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:08,776
It means you sleep together, but you can't get none.

8
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:15,413
Watch it with all that shit, all right?

9
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,321
Look, where's your cup holders?

10
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:23,022
- I don't have one. - You don't have one?

11
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:25,123
$80,000 for this car, and you ain't got no cup holder?

12
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:29,601
It's $105,000. This is one of the
fastest production cars on the planet.

13
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:32,833
Zero to sixty in four seconds,
sweetie. This is a limited edition.

14
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:36,877
You damn right it's limited. No cup holder, no backseat.

15
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,345
It's a shiny dick with two chairs in it.

16
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:42,245
I guess we the balls just dragging the fuck along.

17
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:46,254
Damn. Sorry.

18
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:54,927
- Get it. - I can't get down there.

19
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,466
You got an engine floor up here.
My shit won't go down in there.

20
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,661
Go. Titty-titty, strutty-strutty.

21
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:03,499
Go on. Make them want it.

22
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:06,302
I ain't your wife to be cleaning up after you.

23
00:02:06,408 --> 00:02:10,276
Watch my hand. My shit can't get down there. It gets stuck.

24
00:02:10,412 --> 00:02:14,007
- Now, what do you come up with this shit. - Get that fry.

25
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:17,483
This ain't no goddamn Denny's. Don't eat in my car.

26
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,088
I wouldn't buy shit from Denny's. I
don't like the way we been treated.

27
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:23,089
They bit, Jack. Let's skank these fools.

28
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:27,322
You ain't interested in the fry. You all up in that.

29
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:29,488
- Get out of the car, man. - Shit.

30
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,396
- What the fuck? - Me and my team have had a big week...

31
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:34,469
so just get the fuck out of the car.

32
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,062
Damn. What are you weighing, 350?

33
00:02:38,207 --> 00:02:40,300
I bet you're a big chicken-eating motherfucker.

34
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:44,071
- Get the fuck out. - I always get the big motherfuckers.

35
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:47,114
- Get out of the car now! - All right!

36
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:50,549
- Hold on. - Now this is some funny shit.

37
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:52,280
Let me tell you how bad a day you're having.

38
00:02:52,388 --> 00:02:53,980
You're jacking two cops.

39
00:02:54,089 --> 00:02:57,217
Yeah? I'm a stand-up comedian, and I suck!

40
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:00,590
- That's why I need your car. - I ain't no Wesley Snipes.

41
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:04,393
I just hang out with stupid-ass
friends that drive stupid-ass cars...

42
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,594
that attract a lot of motherfucking attention!

43
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:11,035
I need to jump over this car and smack you in your head.

44
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,166
- You're arguing over a French
fry! - It's not about the French fry!

45
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:16,744
It's about your lack of respect for other people's property!

46
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:19,810
- Shut the fuck up! - This shit is stupid.

47
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:21,906
Hold the fuck on!

48
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:24,315
You want something bad enough? Come get some!

49
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:29,190
You like that shit?

50
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,919
Wesley Snipes, Passenger57.

51
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:34,791
Now give me a motherfucking Handiwipe.

52
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:36,865
Let's hear one of those jokes, bitch.

53
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:14,559
What do you think, guys? Looks like the real thing.

54
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:16,357
You remember your assignment?

55
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:18,296
Yeah, I'm the decoy.

56
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,958
Yes, you are.

57
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:28,800
What the fuck you doing?

58
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:31,712
Hello. Police?

59
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:36,217
I just saw a policeman shot on
South Miami and First Street.

60
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:37,717
Help, please.

61
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,754
<i>All units, officer down.</i>

62
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:41,914
<i>Officer down. Respond code three.</i>

63
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:49,094
<i>All units in the vicinity, respond and identify.</i>

64
00:06:06,815 --> 00:06:09,943
<i>This is Air Unit Two. We've got a full perimeter.</i>

65
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:12,247
<i>Officer down. We need additional ground units.</i>

66
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:21,324
<i>Air Three, roger. Suspector suspects unknown.</i>

67
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:29,199
Gentlemen, it's clear.

68
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:03,734
We're inside.

69
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:11,846
- We're in. - You got 20 minutes.

70
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,851
Goddamn taco is gonna kill me.

71
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,538
Guys, you got 12minutes. Let's go.

72
00:07:58,994 --> 00:08:00,894
Clear. We're in.

73
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:29,542
Move your ass. We've got six minutes.

74
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:32,889
Ready.

75
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,931
Ready to fire. Go!

76
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,574
Fire!

77
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,177
- Clear. - Go.

78
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:13,296
Come on! Let's go! Get out of here! Move it!

79
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:41,461
Damn.

80
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:44,031
Did you have sweet dreams?

81
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:48,761
You're so nasty.

82
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,135
You're always saying you want quality time.

83
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,199
Right now, I got the time and
you damn sure got the quality.

84
00:09:57,412 --> 00:10:00,745
- Come on now. - You know what it is?

85
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:06,352
I can't remember the last time we fell asleep together.

86
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:14,627
Baby, it's my job. It's what it requires.

87
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,166
I'm a better cop when I get some in the morning.

88
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:21,326
- I feel lighter on my feet. - Keep it in your pants, baby.

89
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:23,336
I hear three little Burnetts coming down the hall.

90
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:26,874
That's cold. You're leaving me here like a humping dog.

91
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:31,042
- Hi, baby boy. - Mommy.

92
00:10:31,146 --> 00:10:33,410
- Boy, what's up? - Daddy!

93
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,753
Dad, at school, people say I look weird.

94
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:44,052
They say my ears look funny.

95
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,026
Boy, your daddy has that same problem. I got the ears.

96
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,656
You know what? They just out there
for you to listen to people's problems.

97
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:52,996
You're an angel. These are your wings.

98
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:54,591
That's all.

99
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:56,795
James, stop. Would you take them off...

100
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:59,772
Your ears are better for you to listen with.

101
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,934
Don't let me come down to school. I'll arrest the principal.

102
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:03,943
- Mom! - What?

103
00:11:04,045 --> 00:11:06,013
- James keeps pushing me! Quit
it! - Talking about my boy's ears.

104
00:11:06,114 --> 00:11:07,638
Do what your mama said.

105
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:10,741
- Uncle Mike's in the house. - What's up, Uncle Mike?

106
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:12,717
- Partner. - What's going on?

107
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:14,254
Quincy, check it out.

108
00:11:14,356 --> 00:11:17,519
- Why did you take my food? - Hey, girl.

109
00:11:17,626 --> 00:11:20,754
Don't kiss me. I don't know
where your lips were last night. Move.

110
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:25,063
Uncle Mike, did you have a date last night?

111
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,067
Did I!

112
00:11:27,169 --> 00:11:29,865
- Let me tell you, boy. This girl was... - Hey!

113
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:32,769
Don't tell my son your sleazy sex stories.

114
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:35,775
I only tell your husband my sleazy sex stories.

115
00:11:35,877 --> 00:11:38,368
I don't want him knowing about
them either; gives him ideas.

116
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,916
Why you putting me in this? I'm with my babies.

117
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:44,713
- Thank you. - Hello?

118
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,584
- Eat. Go on, girl. - No problem.

119
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:55,690
- You're on the mike with Mike. -
Want Daddy to wipe your mouth?

120
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:59,824
I think you mean to say, "Get our
asses down there, please, " Captain.

121
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:02,836
- Now! - Maybe not.

122
00:12:10,212 --> 00:12:11,611
What's up, boy?

123
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:16,381
- Hey, baby! - Hey, Francine. Where's Howard?

124
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,648
He's down there. He's looking
for you. He's been in better moods.

125
00:12:22,257 --> 00:12:24,122
Damn.

126
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:26,456
Get it done, goddamn it.

127
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:29,696
Welcome to our nightmare, boys.

128
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:35,294
See this? What's wrong with this picture?

129
00:12:35,403 --> 00:12:37,303
Remember this room?

130
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:40,241
Don't these flats look familiar?

131
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,800
There were these silver packets. They looked like bricks.

132
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:46,346
Little red tags on them, about so high.

133
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:48,245
- All that heroin is gone. - This was our career bust...

134
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,409
worth $100 million.

135
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,850
- Gone. - This is bad.

136
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:55,479
No, let me call it what it is. This is fucked up.

137
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,253
- You got that right, detective. - Hello, Alison.

138
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:03,195
You guys know Captain Sinclair,
Internal Affairs' top watchdog.

139
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:06,131
I'd actually take that as a compliment
if I didn't know you so well.

140
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:10,637
Excuse me, but if you two want to
get personal, I could step out...

141
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,468
There's nothing personal here. I'm just doing my job.

142
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:15,008
I love knowing that one leak...

143
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,511
one headline could turn this nightmare into a media frenzy.

144
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:22,379
That won't happen. We'll get the
dope back before that ever happens.

145
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:24,179
Good. Start by looking right here.

146
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:28,222
This had to be an inside job, and I'll find out about it.

147
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:31,354
Sanchez, Ruiz, you're late.

148
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:37,661
Somebody put this in for toxic drug fumes.

149
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:39,631
Yeah, this was a brilliant design.

150
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:41,861
This was really intelligent. I like this.

151
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,734
I didn't ask how he feels. I said, "What did he see?

152
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,773
What does he know?"

153
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,777
Where werey'all last night?

154
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:53,210
Have your cousins bring the shit
back, and we can all get some sleep.

155
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:56,216
We were gonna do that, but we came up with a problem.

156
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:58,650
Your mama snorted up all the dope.

157
00:13:58,753 --> 00:14:00,380
You two, get over there.

158
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:05,551
O'Fee will be all right, but he's got nothing to tell us.

159
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,221
So they kill a decoy, it empties the station. Very smart.

160
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:12,765
But they don't kill a real cop because
they had the whole force on their ass.

161
00:14:12,867 --> 00:14:15,700
This was your case. You're back on it.

162
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:19,205
Sanchez, Ruiz, you back them up with whatever they need.

163
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:21,901
- With whatever they need. Shut your mouths.
- But wait a second.

164
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,103
It was Carrera's drugs in the first place.

165
00:14:24,212 --> 00:14:26,373
But it couldn't have been him
because he was killed in prison.

166
00:14:26,481 --> 00:14:28,278
What about the rest of his crew?

167
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:30,351
Those idiots don't have the precision to do this, but...

168
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:32,749
just in case I'm wrong, you check them out.

169
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:36,881
They'd have been up here with Uzis,
splashing O'Fee all over the place.

170
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:38,720
Takes a lot of brains to pull this off.

171
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,819
- Big cojones too. - What the hell are you talking about?

172
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:45,933
It would take me a month to explain to you what cojones is.

173
00:14:46,034 --> 00:14:48,059
- You're in Miami. You don't know... - In English.

174
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,060
Hold, hold. Hey!
We've got nothing!

175
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:54,069
What's the matter with you? We've got nothing!

176
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:57,110
The guy who pulled this off knew what he was doing...

177
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:59,612
and he left us nothing but a big "Fuck you."

178
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:04,477
Ruiz, Sanchez, find out who installed the ventilating system, ok? . Do that now.

179
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:09,949
- That's cold. - Yeah, so is your mama's bed.

180
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:12,356
This could definitely be an inside job. Don't rule it out.

181
00:15:13,728 --> 00:15:17,129
We've got 72 hours before the FBI and the DEA...

182
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:20,633
walk in here and shut us down, and we'll be the bad guys.

183
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:23,761
Politics demand that somebody take the rap for this.

184
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:29,172
It's going to be us. Just do what you do, only faster.

185
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:30,972
Jo jo, what's up?

186
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,139
You're still a chemist, right?
Cutting drugs and shit like that?

187
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:38,151
I don't know nothing about that.
I'm out of the drug business.

188
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:40,278
- You know something. - You don't know nothing?

189
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:42,185
I just said no to drugs. That's it.

190
00:15:42,186 --> 00:15:43,186
You said no to drugs. So what?

191
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,590
- What are you into, Jo? - I'm into rubber.

192
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,994
- You're selling tires? - Yeah.

193
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:54,090
- Jo jo don't know nothing. - Nothing. I know tires.

194
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:57,638
- All right. You're telling me the truth, right?
- Would I lie to you?

195
00:15:57,772 --> 00:15:59,501
- Would you lie to me? - I'm driving.

196
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:10,312
- Man, this is a waste of time. - Come on.

197
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:13,910
I keep telling you in Max's line of work,
she definitely gets the 411.

198
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:17,650
Maxi! How did I know I would find you up in here?

199
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,030
We have to talk. Is there someplace we can go?

200
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:25,792
Yeah. Equipment room?

201
00:16:25,934 --> 00:16:28,129
- Behave your self. - I'm cool.

202
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,240
Listen, I need some help, again.

203
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,840
What else is new?

204
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:59,356
Major ill shit happened down at the police department.

205
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:02,197
There's a lot of hero in involved.
There will be a lot of cash involved.

206
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:05,568
There will definitely be some jolly young
men who want to party.

207
00:17:05,673 --> 00:17:07,197
What do you need?

208
00:17:07,342 --> 00:17:09,708
A lot of people will talk to you that won't talk to me.

209
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:12,746
You mean customers?

210
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:15,372
I'm not asking you to get into any wild shit.

211
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:19,783
- Just call me if you hear something. - I think I will call you.

212
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,721
What the hell are you doing?

213
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,801
Trying to keep my shit quick.

214
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:35,392
That's right. You ain't getting none at home.

215
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:37,903
You got extra energy. Go ahead. Burn it off, baby.

216
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:41,870
We got anything, Francine?

217
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:44,570
Sanchez says the air-conditioning contract went...

218
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:47,272
to Manuel Arrona of Key Biscayne.

219
00:17:47,415 --> 00:17:51,408
He's working out of his house this week. That's the number.

220
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:00,258
He's not answering.

221
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:02,591
I guess we should just leave.

222
00:18:02,697 --> 00:18:06,690
What? Make a trip all the way down
here to high society for nothing?

223
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,427
That's why they have windows.

224
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,435
- We can peek in. - Yeah, that should do it.

225
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,278
- I tripped. - The handle just opened?

226
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:20,108
Right after I tripped, it just opened.

227
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:24,447
I guess they want us to come in, take a peek.

228
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:26,781
Hello?

229
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:29,254
We're your new neighbors.

230
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,882
Don't be alarmed. We're Negroes.

231
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:34,791
No, man. Nah, there's too much bass in your voice.

232
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,387
That scares white folks. You've got to sound like them.

233
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:41,127
We were wondering if we could borrow some brown sugar?

234
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:50,471
- You fart? - No, man.

235
00:18:52,413 --> 00:18:54,210
Dead guy.

236
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:06,491
Well, looks like somebody's home.

237
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:19,334
Ok. Let me take a stab at this one.

238
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,034
He sells the ventilation plans to the bad guys.

239
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:25,510
- He gets rich, but he gets dead. - You're right on that one.

240
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:28,639
- I'll go call Homicide. - Whoa. Wait.

241
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,877
Why do you act like this every
time we're around a dead body?

242
00:19:30,985 --> 00:19:33,453
It's cool. I just...

243
00:19:33,554 --> 00:19:35,715
Please, look around.

244
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:39,552
The smell and the fumes...

245
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:41,561
It's just unexpected, that's all.

246
00:19:51,272 --> 00:19:54,070
Looks like our buddy Arrona was a bit of a gambler.

247
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:56,040
He's got dog track, jai alai.

248
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,907
Probably needed the money to pay off his debts.

249
00:19:58,012 --> 00:19:59,411
Bookie.

250
00:20:02,684 --> 00:20:04,709
- Whoops. - Damn, man.

251
00:20:04,852 --> 00:20:06,649
Watch where you're swinging a dead leg.

252
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:08,221
My bad.

253
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:10,985
Damn this. I'm calling Homicide.

254
00:20:11,092 --> 00:20:12,957
I'm a narcotics cop.

255
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,957
Dead bodies.

256
00:20:19,467 --> 00:20:21,560
Dead ends.

257
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:29,609
Maggots. Man, uh...

258
00:20:32,714 --> 00:20:36,411
- What's wrong with you, man?
- Look...No, see, I'm, Ah...A little nauseous...

259
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:40,647
I'm gonna...

260
00:20:48,696 --> 00:20:50,323
Hey, what do you say we grab a couple burritos?

261
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:56,601
You drive almost slow enough to drive Miss Daisy.

262
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,032
Hey man, the transaction is done, all right?

263
00:21:02,143 --> 00:21:04,543
- We ain't got shit, so it's over. - Relax.

264
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:07,113
We got it before. We'll get it again.

265
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:09,775
Yeah, yeah, you got it all figured out, don't you?

266
00:21:09,884 --> 00:21:11,613
You got to have faith, player.

267
00:21:11,753 --> 00:21:15,245
Let me tell you something, all right?
By the time we figured out how, we'd be out of a job.

268
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:19,793
No, scratch that. Everybody in
the damn unit will be out of a job.

269
00:21:19,894 --> 00:21:24,888
But don't worry. They tend to
think Mike Lowrey will be all right.

270
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:29,163
Especially since they think you some rich kid playing cop.

271
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,603
Look, man, I ain't got no trust fund.

272
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:36,143
Okey? See for me, no job, no check.

273
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:40,340
That's like all the other guys in the unit.
Least, most of us.

274
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:42,473
So I'm playing cop now?

275
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:45,912
This is a game. I'm just joking around.

276
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,488
You always wanted to be Starsky or Hutch.

277
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:55,325
Know what? I'm so sick of this bullshit.

278
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,957
I'm supposed to apologize for
my family leaving me money?

279
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,661
All I ever wanted to be was a cop.

280
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:04,271
I get up early and take it to the max every day.

281
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:07,671
I'm the first guy through the door
and the last to leave the crime scene...

282
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:10,005
so fuck you and fuck them...

283
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:13,342
and fuck everybody who got a problem with Mike Lowrey.

284
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:18,084
- I love you, man. - Fuck you, Marcus.

285
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:24,848
I do. You're cool with me. You're my partner.

286
00:22:24,959 --> 00:22:28,122
Shut up. Slow-ass driver.

287
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:30,129
- Driving like a bitch. - Why I got to be all that?

288
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,359
- Slow-ass Miss Daisy. - I'll take me and you off this cliff...

289
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:36,027
you keep fucking with me.

290
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:38,537
Then it will be two bitches in the sea.

291
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:41,699
- Is that what you want? - Shut up.

292
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:44,744
My wife know I ain't no bitch.

293
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:47,542
- Yeah. - I'm a bad boy.

294
00:22:47,648 --> 00:22:51,414
<i>Badboys, badboys What you gonna do</i>

295
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:54,317
<i>What you gonna do when they come for you</i>

296
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:56,549
Shelly, only models, and that's all.

297
00:22:56,657 --> 00:22:58,420
<i>Max just dropped by. I have to go.</i>

298
00:22:58,526 --> 00:23:00,289
Bye.

299
00:23:01,662 --> 00:23:05,223
You want me to call around looking for the newly rich?

300
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:09,429
Are there any new guys partying
a lot, spending a lot of money?

301
00:23:09,537 --> 00:23:11,732
Actually, this guy called me this morning, desperate...

302
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,739
every two hours... looking for new girls in town.

303
00:23:13,841 --> 00:23:15,331
Are you available this afternoon?

304
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:18,606
- It will be a quick $2,000. - I've got plans with Julie.

305
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:20,738
- She's your roommate, right? - Yeah.

306
00:23:20,848 --> 00:23:23,248
Bring her. She's cute. She's sexy. Go on.

307
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:26,912
- She's not a working girl, Lois. -
Doesn't matter. He's on speedballs.

308
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:29,421
He's probably so messed up, he can't even get it up.

309
00:23:29,524 --> 00:23:31,583
Maybe we'll go check it out.

310
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:34,058
It could be the party I'm looking for.

311
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:37,757
A party at the Bilt more? That will really rock.

312
00:23:37,865 --> 00:23:40,425
- Julie, I owe you one. - Forget about it.

313
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:43,436
I'll just deduct it from the hundreds
off avors I already owe you.

314
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:46,098
Am I turning into the guest that won't leave?

315
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:48,607
I like having you live with me.

316
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:51,610
I'm an out-of-work photographer
who doesn't know how to cook.

317
00:23:51,712 --> 00:23:54,545
- Not a big upside for you there. - Come on.

318
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:58,779
So, what incredibly hip individual
inspired this visit to the Bilt more?

319
00:23:58,886 --> 00:24:01,116
- It's a favor for Mike Lowrey. - Right.

320
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:04,123
The cop who I think you may be a little bit in love with.

321
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,625
Maybe I am, but we're just friends.

322
00:24:06,727 --> 00:24:11,289
And if I were ever in trouble, he's
the only person I would call.

323
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:14,391
I know. I think I've heard this before.

324
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:18,569
- Hello. - Hi.

325
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:21,005
You must be Max.

326
00:24:21,108 --> 00:24:23,008
Welcome. I'm Eddie.

327
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,305
The Al Capone suite.

328
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:29,850
- I guess we're a little early. - This is my friend, Julie.

329
00:24:29,851 --> 00:24:30,851
- Julie?
- Hi.

330
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,083
You like Al Capone, don't you?

331
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,090
I hadn't really thought about it much.

332
00:24:39,927 --> 00:24:42,589
I'm not kidding about this being Capone's.

333
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:46,690
He had the place rigged with secret passageways.

334
00:24:46,801 --> 00:24:48,701
Ten minutes, we're out of here.

335
00:24:48,803 --> 00:24:50,828
- Five. - One drink.

336
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:52,530
- What's the whispering about? - One sip.

337
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,335
It's Eddie here.

338
00:24:54,442 --> 00:24:56,171
Just girl chat.

339
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:58,472
Where's the bathroom?

340
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:00,444
Upstairs on your right.

341
00:25:01,616 --> 00:25:03,607
Watch your step.

342
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:08,353
Come. Sit.

343
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:10,515
Enjoy your self. Relax.

344
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:13,617
Eddie's got some favors to play with.

345
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,958
Yes, Eddie does.

346
00:25:16,063 --> 00:25:18,691
I should have told you sooner about Eddie's private party.

347
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,530
Now it's a surprise party.

348
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:33,038
Okay, Max, we've been here about five minutes too long.

349
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:41,388
I see you treat your self well.

350
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,889
Yeah.

351
00:25:46,494 --> 00:25:50,555
I needed to blow off a little steam
after the move, you know?

352
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:54,863
So a little party with a couple of friends. That's all.

353
00:25:54,969 --> 00:25:58,097
I was gonna invite you guys.

354
00:25:58,205 --> 00:26:02,073
Invite? It looks like I'm catering this.

355
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:07,402
I was looking for my two keys of dope,
and now I know where they are.

356
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:09,415
Yours? It's our score.

357
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,417
- And the girl? - Nobody.

358
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:18,219
- Just entertainment. - Hi, I'm Max.

359
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,021
Nice to meet you.

360
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:26,363
I like a woman who takes pride in her appearance.

361
00:26:27,735 --> 00:26:30,602
Don't you?

362
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:34,368
Yeah, I hate when a bitch lets her self slide.

363
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:37,376
You look like a model in that dress.

364
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:38,877
Will you model for me, Max?

365
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:49,113
Great. It's the goon squad.

366
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,251
You were a cop for so long, you should know hookers talk.

367
00:27:19,353 --> 00:27:22,379
You couldn't wait four more days until I made the deal?

368
00:27:22,523 --> 00:27:24,821
I can't work with that kind of stupidity!

369
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:28,759
Stupidity? I got you connected inside!

370
00:27:29,864 --> 00:27:32,355
I brought you my family.

371
00:27:32,466 --> 00:27:36,766
Eddie, it's my family now.

372
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,174
Fouchet, we're still friends.

373
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:44,711
- What are you guys doing? - You pissed him off.

374
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,774
Use a smaller gun. You got blood on me again.

375
00:27:48,883 --> 00:27:52,785
- Somebody's upstairs. - Where? Go!

376
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:55,721
Get her! Move, Fergie!

377
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:12,038
Get her!

378
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:13,936
What the fuck?

379
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:19,904
Fucking shoes suck! Get her!

380
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:22,949
- God! - Move it!

381
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:30,550
Go!

382
00:28:32,693 --> 00:28:34,718
Shoot her!

383
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:54,409
- I got her. Bullshit. - I got her.

384
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:57,245
No, I got her. What do you know about shooting?

385
00:28:57,351 --> 00:28:59,285
I can't believe she made it.

386
00:28:59,386 --> 00:29:01,479
- Jesus. - Are you serious?

387
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:04,285
- She jumped. - Fuck.

388
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,760
Find out who she worked for and where she lives.

389
00:29:18,706 --> 00:29:23,109
It's about fucking time. Lowrey, Burnett, come here!

390
00:29:23,244 --> 00:29:25,974
Look at this. You see this guy?

391
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,707
- He's dead, right? - Yeah.

392
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:30,113
- He look familiar? - Eddie Dominguez.

393
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:32,310
- The ex-cop. - Two points for you.

394
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:34,819
There's some of our high-grade heroin over there.

395
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:37,755
Sinclair will love that headline.

396
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:39,792
There's no signs of forced entry.

397
00:29:39,894 --> 00:29:42,488
What the fuck is all this? It looks like Beirut.

398
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:44,257
It's the Al Capone suite.

399
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,526
What can I say? Shit happens.

400
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:50,433
This is a real shitty day.

401
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,666
Looks like we have two shades of lipstick here, gentlemen.

402
00:29:53,774 --> 00:29:55,799
Somebody is missing from the party.

403
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,377
Listen to me.

404
00:29:57,511 --> 00:30:01,413
Your only function in life right now
is to find that person. Find her.

405
00:30:01,515 --> 00:30:03,676
It's the only good lead we got all day.

406
00:30:03,784 --> 00:30:06,218
Man, I'll check all calls to the room.

407
00:30:16,964 --> 00:30:19,398
What you got over there, partner?

408
00:30:30,878 --> 00:30:32,277
Cover her.

409
00:30:35,783 --> 00:30:37,478
He knew the girl?

410
00:30:50,297 --> 00:30:52,231
Look, man...

411
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,268
we'll get the witness and the fools who did this.

412
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:58,803
Yeah. Listen, why don't you see if you can catch a ride with Howard.

413
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:02,204
- Where you going? - Eight calls were made to Lois Fields.

414
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:04,675
That's who Max used to work for. I'll check that out.

415
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:07,906
- I'll come with you. - I'm all right. We'll catch up later.

416
00:31:08,015 --> 00:31:12,281
- You okay? - I'm cool.

417
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:22,561
Hello?

418
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:29,234
Shit.

419
00:31:33,674 --> 00:31:38,236
Yeah, baby. Look, I know quality time was my idea.

420
00:31:38,345 --> 00:31:41,405
- Don't talk about quality time. - But... Hold on, baby.

421
00:31:41,515 --> 00:31:44,746
Look here, I need a full file on Eddie Dominguez.

422
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:46,547
- That will take a minute. - Hold on.

423
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:48,552
- Marcus, I got on there done. - Baby?

424
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,420
You have on the red one? The one with the snaps?

425
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:53,550
- Why couldn't you wait till... - You're never home.

426
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:55,889
- Theresa... Hold on. - All his file sareblocked.

427
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,464
I don't give a damn about his personal files.

428
00:31:58,565 --> 00:32:02,023
- The man's dead. Unblock it. - Screw you. That's illegal.

429
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:03,568
Screw you!

430
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:07,769
- Fucking... - Marcus, are you talking tome?

431
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:10,935
I'm not talking to... It's a term you use, baby.

432
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:13,775
- "Screw you" is a cop term. - You ain't screwing nothing!

433
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:16,448
Goddamn it!

434
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:21,988
Where's Lowrey?

435
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:23,579
I just paged him.

436
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:26,192
He's following up this Lois Fields lead.

437
00:32:26,326 --> 00:32:27,691
The madam?

438
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:46,877
21-2, request backup. 614 Reach Road.

439
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:18,968
Don't mess with us.

440
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,309
That might be him.

441
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,110
Yeah. Lowrey's desk.

442
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:30,155
I need to talk to Detective Mike Lowrey.

443
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,985
This is Captain Howard. Can I help you?

444
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:34,856
You can get me Lowrey.

445
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:36,929
This is not another paternity case, is it?

446
00:33:37,064 --> 00:33:40,090
No, it's another murder case, you twerp.

447
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,828
Are you talking about the murder
case at the Biltmore Hotel tonight?

448
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:47,066
Listen, I've just seen my best friend get murdered...

449
00:33:47,174 --> 00:33:50,337
and I'll only talk to Mike Lowrey.

450
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:52,537
Why only Mike Lowrey? I have a detective here...

451
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:54,579
None of your fucking business.

452
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:57,149
Either I talk to Lowrey or I'm blowing town.

453
00:33:57,284 --> 00:33:59,309
Mike, telephone!

454
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:02,855
He's coming right now. Hold on, please.

455
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,515
- Talk to her. - I ain't got time for these games.

456
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:07,991
This is the witness, the girl at the hotel.

457
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:11,531
Yeah, he just got out of the john. Hold on. Talk to her.

458
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,692
- If you don't talk to her, she'll
walk. - Captain, I can't be Mike.

459
00:34:14,835 --> 00:34:16,393
Just talk to her now. She's gonna walk.

460
00:34:16,537 --> 00:34:18,698
- This is our witness. - Calm down.

461
00:34:24,244 --> 00:34:27,213
Hello. This is Mike Lowrey.

462
00:34:28,482 --> 00:34:31,713
He doesn't talk that way. Try to talk sexy.

463
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:33,717
- Come on. - You don't sound sexy enough.

464
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:36,516
Captain! I've been there.

465
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:42,357
You don't know me. My name's Julie Mott.

466
00:34:42,462 --> 00:34:44,555
I was Max Logan's best friend.

467
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:48,226
Whoa. Calm down. Talk to me now.

468
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:54,937
- Yeah. - She said if she ever needed anything...

469
00:34:57,211 --> 00:34:59,179
I need your help.

470
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:02,737
Give me the address. All right.

471
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:05,374
It's gonna be all right. Mike's to the rescue.

472
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,249
- I'm on the way. All right. - I'll see if I can find Lowrey.

473
00:35:08,388 --> 00:35:09,855
- I can't go. - You have to go.

474
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,584
- Go! - Get Mike down here to handle this.

475
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,253
Get to this address now. Get out of the chair.

476
00:35:15,395 --> 00:35:19,798
- You won't see your wife for a month! - Goddamn it, man.

477
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:20,799
Get this fucking door fixed.

478
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:33,379
Get this fucking door fixed.

479
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,455
Easy.

480
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:49,151
Shit.

481
00:35:50,564 --> 00:35:54,660
- Who's there? - Mike Lowrey.

482
00:35:54,768 --> 00:35:56,736
How do I know it's Mike Lowrey?

483
00:35:56,837 --> 00:35:59,397
'Cause I'm Mike Lowrey.

484
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:01,302
We ain't got much time.

485
00:36:01,441 --> 00:36:03,739
Hold your badge up to the peephole.

486
00:36:03,844 --> 00:36:06,677
I'm not letting you in until you do!

487
00:36:14,588 --> 00:36:15,646
No way.

488
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:20,625
- What was that for? - You're not Mike Lowrey!

489
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,525
What do you mean? You never even met him... me.

490
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,497
- Max described you differently! - I'm undercover!

491
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,431
- All right! - Prove it!

492
00:36:28,568 --> 00:36:30,832
I knew Max from way back.

493
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:33,963
- I helped her brother get out of jail. - Yeah, so?

494
00:36:34,074 --> 00:36:38,511
So, from time to time, we'd get
together, a little bump and grind.

495
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:41,342
- Wrong. - Give me that!

496
00:36:41,481 --> 00:36:45,542
Give me the bat! You want to go out? Fine!

497
00:36:45,652 --> 00:36:47,711
You don't want to believe me, you go at this shit alone!

498
00:36:49,623 --> 00:36:54,219
I forgot! The bad guys probably know where you live.

499
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:56,922
Which means they're coming for your ass. Good luck.

500
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:01,628
I saw the whole thing.

501
00:37:02,903 --> 00:37:05,997
I watched them shoot her like she was nothing.

502
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:10,308
Please shut the door.

503
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:17,911
Look, lady...

504
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:20,418
do you have any more bats, golf clubs...

505
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,479
or anything like that you could swing at me?

506
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:26,650
I knew Max.

507
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,390
I care about Max also.

508
00:37:31,498 --> 00:37:34,399
I'm just here to help you.

509
00:37:36,636 --> 00:37:38,297
You're not what I expected.

510
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:42,802
I didn't expect to walk into Yankee Stadium either.

511
00:37:44,444 --> 00:37:49,677
Now, we have to get out of here. Let's go.

512
00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:51,410
I have to get my dogs. Come here, Dukie.

513
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:54,419
Come here, Lukie, Dukie, whatever.

514
00:37:54,521 --> 00:37:56,955
You got a back door?

515
00:37:57,057 --> 00:37:58,615
Where are we going?

516
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:02,889
- Protective custody. - Fuck that. I'm only dealing with you.

517
00:38:02,996 --> 00:38:05,760
That was a cop that threw that
little party back at the Biltmore.

518
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,801
Former cop. We got rid of him a long time ago.

519
00:38:08,902 --> 00:38:10,995
- Come on, Luke. - Listen, lady.

520
00:38:11,104 --> 00:38:14,335
If you want to live, you ain't got
no choice. You got to trust me.

521
00:38:16,977 --> 00:38:19,309
- My God! - Go!

522
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,639
Move!

523
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:33,783
Run!

524
00:38:46,373 --> 00:38:49,809
- Get the dog! - Here, doggie!

525
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,936
Jesus Christ! Who the hell was that?

526
00:38:53,046 --> 00:38:56,777
- Let's go! - There is too much killing going on!

527
00:38:56,883 --> 00:38:59,511
- Go after them! I'll go around front! - I got them!

528
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:05,589
Come on! Move your ass! Let's go!

529
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:10,385
Fuck.

530
00:39:21,575 --> 00:39:24,738
- Get in the car! - Damn it.

531
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:32,376
- Go, goddamn it! - Fucking door!

532
00:39:41,094 --> 00:39:44,996
How did you miss them? You fat fuck!

533
00:39:45,098 --> 00:39:46,725
Watch your fucking mouth!

534
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,664
If you'd lose some weight, you would have caught them!

535
00:39:48,768 --> 00:39:51,498
I'd like to squeeze your little fucking head, you bastard!

536
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:53,573
Now you're in fucking trouble!

537
00:39:53,673 --> 00:39:56,039
- You get the license plate? - Yeah, I got the fucking plate.

538
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,633
You cockeyed fuck.

539
00:39:58,778 --> 00:40:00,575
This is your getaway car?

540
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,446
We won't get away from anything in this.
Is this a goddamn family station wagon?

541
00:40:04,551 --> 00:40:07,418
My God, you have a baby seat in the back.

542
00:40:07,521 --> 00:40:10,217
It's an undercover car.

543
00:40:10,323 --> 00:40:13,190
Shit! I know they got a look at my license plate.

544
00:40:13,293 --> 00:40:15,090
Were those the guys who shot Max?

545
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:16,685
What guys? I only saw bullets.

546
00:40:16,796 --> 00:40:18,320
You tell me what they looked like.

547
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:21,332
I don't know! I was too busy trying
to keep a bullet out your ass!

548
00:40:21,434 --> 00:40:24,926
Julie, I'll need you to look through some mug shots...

549
00:40:25,038 --> 00:40:27,029
until you can identify Max's shooter.

550
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,165
- Where will we do that? - Protective custody.

551
00:40:29,276 --> 00:40:32,507
No way! I told you I am not going into protective custody!

552
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:35,706
Look, lady, I'm not playing. You're really pissing me off!

553
00:40:35,815 --> 00:40:37,373
I'll book your narrow ass!

554
00:40:37,484 --> 00:40:39,281
Yeah? I'll develop amnesia.

555
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:42,253
I suddenly feel a little case of it coming on right now.

556
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:45,188
Fine, lady. Where would you feel safe?

557
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:47,522
You want to do protective custody?

558
00:40:47,627 --> 00:40:49,322
We'll do in-home protective custody.

559
00:40:49,429 --> 00:40:52,262
At your place, all right? I can handle going to your place.

560
00:40:52,365 --> 00:40:53,889
Yeah, my place.

561
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,525
My place is... No way.

562
00:40:58,471 --> 00:41:02,931
Right. My place. Yeah, my place is shit.

563
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,910
Mike Lowrey place. You right.

564
00:41:06,012 --> 00:41:08,037
That's the best idea you came up with tonight.

565
00:41:12,786 --> 00:41:15,118
Wait here.

566
00:41:21,094 --> 00:41:24,427
- Detective Burnett, how are you ? - I'm cool.

567
00:41:24,531 --> 00:41:26,396
- Mr. Lowrey's not here. He's out. - I know.

568
00:41:26,499 --> 00:41:28,330
- He said I could use his place tonight. - Really?

569
00:41:28,435 --> 00:41:30,528
He didn't mention it to me.

570
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,965
Who's the chick? How's your wife?

571
00:41:37,844 --> 00:41:39,471
She's fine.

572
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:40,978
Your kids are good?

573
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:44,073
- Family's the most important thing. - Is it?

574
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:46,277
Mr. Lowrey told me you got a baby
factory going on at your house.

575
00:41:46,386 --> 00:41:49,184
- Is that true? - Here you go.

576
00:41:51,124 --> 00:41:53,615
If that ain't enough, I'll run you in for extortion.

577
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:55,957
You know, I'm so stupid sometimes.

578
00:41:56,062 --> 00:41:57,996
- Are you ? - Now that you mention it...

579
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,464
Mr. Lowrey did mention you coming by tonight.

580
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:02,057
What did he say? Did he say he had a key?

581
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:06,698
- Hang out. Here you go. - Hang out?

582
00:42:06,806 --> 00:42:08,603
- Is this it? - Yeah. You're hurting me.

583
00:42:08,708 --> 00:42:10,835
- Thank you . - Good to see you.

584
00:42:10,944 --> 00:42:13,538
- Good to see you . - Have fun.

585
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:16,377
- It's not like that. - Sure.

586
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:27,156
Yeah, come on. Watch your step walking through.

587
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,820
Damn, I must have left some incense burning.

588
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:32,762
Welcome to Casa de Lowrey.

589
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,660
This is kind of...

590
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:39,000
I'm always moving my switches.

591
00:42:39,105 --> 00:42:41,369
I'm always decorating, so sometimes
I just don't know where shit is.

592
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:45,142
Damn! Shit!

593
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,939
Why am I tripping on shit I know is there?

594
00:42:51,518 --> 00:42:52,917
You found a light switch.

595
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:55,817
I should have known it was there
since I decorated the place.

596
00:42:55,922 --> 00:42:57,719
<i>Yeah.</i>

597
00:42:57,824 --> 00:42:59,519
<i>Hi, Mike. This is Yvette.</i>

598
00:42:59,626 --> 00:43:02,686
Ignore this. It's one of my freaks, Yvette.

599
00:43:02,796 --> 00:43:05,026
She's always calling. Got to have it.

600
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:08,225
Don't call no more now, freak.
Just one of my freaks

601
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:13,204
- All this on a cop's salary? - I feel like having your ight now...

602
00:43:13,306 --> 00:43:14,705
It's honest money.

603
00:43:14,808 --> 00:43:17,106
I'm a second generation rich kid.

604
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:19,576
So if you're not in it for the paycheck...

605
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,011
are you some kind of action junkie?

606
00:43:22,115 --> 00:43:24,447
Yeah. If that's what you want to call it.

607
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:28,749
I don't mind bats swung at my head,
bullets damn near grazing my ass.

608
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:31,722
Gives me a rush. Look...

609
00:43:31,825 --> 00:43:34,350
let me give you a broad stroke of the place.

610
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:37,862
Got some T-bones in the fridge for Luke and Dukie.

611
00:43:37,964 --> 00:43:40,228
Sorry. Your fridge is this way.

612
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:44,292
- Why do I confuse my own shit?
- Wait a minute.

613
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:48,966
- You're leaving me here alone? -
Yeah, I have to get back to work.

614
00:43:49,075 --> 00:43:53,774
- These are Miami's peak crime hours. - Apparently.

615
00:43:55,448 --> 00:43:58,611
They said that this deal was going down in four days.

616
00:43:58,718 --> 00:44:03,382
I obviously seem to be kind of a major glitch...

617
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:07,017
You ain't with the bad guys now.

618
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:08,594
You're with the cops...

619
00:44:08,728 --> 00:44:11,561
with Mike Lowrey.

620
00:44:11,664 --> 00:44:14,462
Everything will be all right. Trust me.

621
00:44:14,567 --> 00:44:16,432
I'll be back.

622
00:44:16,536 --> 00:44:19,994
I know there's no time to joke, but remember in the movie...

623
00:44:21,107 --> 00:44:22,768
All right.

624
00:44:23,843 --> 00:44:26,175
Thanks for everything, Mike.

625
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:29,047
I'm going.

626
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:36,321
- Chet. - That was quick. You one of those guys?

627
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,017
- In and out. - It's not like that.

628
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:41,923
The girl's a witness. I need you to keep an eye out.

629
00:44:42,028 --> 00:44:43,655
- No problem. - Now listen to me.

630
00:44:43,763 --> 00:44:46,254
- Hear me. That's right. - Me?

631
00:44:46,366 --> 00:44:51,326
The moment Lowrey gets in, have him call me at home.

632
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,030
- At my home. - Call you at home.

633
00:44:53,139 --> 00:44:55,004
Use this phone. Do not let him go upstairs.

634
00:44:55,108 --> 00:44:57,133
Don't let him go upstairs? But he lives here.

635
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,507
I don't want to argue with Mr. Lowrey. I could lose my job.

636
00:44:59,612 --> 00:45:01,773
Trust me on this, okay?

637
00:45:01,881 --> 00:45:04,543
Call you from here. Don't let him up.

638
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:06,516
- No problem. - Important witness.

639
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:07,847
Thank you.

640
00:45:07,954 --> 00:45:10,252
I got a better idea. I'm getting off in two hours.

641
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:12,984
Lf you want, I could go upstairs and watch the door.

642
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:15,026
Like the cops do in the movies? They sit on a stool?

643
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:16,527
I got a magazine and everything.

644
00:45:16,629 --> 00:45:18,028
I don't let anybody in or out.

645
00:45:19,432 --> 00:45:22,060
Seriously, all kidding aside, I want to help.

646
00:45:22,168 --> 00:45:24,864
You're helping. Can you do it from here?

647
00:45:24,971 --> 00:45:28,031
- Yeah, I can do it from here. - Fine.

648
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:30,632
- That helps. From here, okay? - All right.

649
00:45:30,743 --> 00:45:34,008
It's funny that you ask me, because I was going to be a cop.

650
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:35,512
I took the test.

651
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:38,550
Just didn't work out. Politics.

652
00:45:38,651 --> 00:45:40,949
Yeah. I know.

653
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:42,988
- You're my deputy. - I'm your deputy.

654
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:45,683
- Watch out for everything. - You got it.

655
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:47,793
Take care, Chief.

656
00:45:47,927 --> 00:45:49,360
I'm a deputy.

657
00:45:49,462 --> 00:45:53,523
Don't "honey baby" me. You smell like perfume.

658
00:45:53,633 --> 00:45:55,066
It was just...

659
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:58,194
You don't even have your wedding ring on!

660
00:45:59,706 --> 00:46:02,231
Damn.

661
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,242
I went undercover.

662
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:09,077
It required taking off the ring
for a second, but I got the ring.

663
00:46:09,182 --> 00:46:11,912
I just put my hand in my pocket
because that's where it was...

664
00:46:12,018 --> 00:46:13,815
and it's right back on, baby.

665
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:19,453
Can I get a pillow?

666
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:19,854
If it isn't the guy who doesn't return phone calls.

667
00:46:23,029 --> 00:46:26,226
Where have you been the last 12 hours?

668
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,266
I've been paging you all night.

669
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:31,098
We got a situation here you need to know about.

670
00:46:31,204 --> 00:46:33,934
Look, I got a dead madam...

671
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,474
I got a concussion and I got a real bad headache.

672
00:46:36,576 --> 00:46:39,306
You got a headache? Let me tell you what I did last night.

673
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:41,403
I had to sleep on my couch.

674
00:46:41,514 --> 00:46:43,948
I wake up with a Power Ranger stuck up my ass.

675
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:47,884
And while we're discussing my
ass, I damn near got it blown off.

676
00:46:47,987 --> 00:46:50,922
But the good news is I got a witness.

677
00:46:51,024 --> 00:46:54,255
Let me tell you about this witness. She likes to...

678
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:59,058
- You sound like a nagging wife. - I'm nagging.

679
00:46:59,165 --> 00:47:02,464
You see what happens when you go
off with out me? You get into shit.

680
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,265
Like shit don't happen when you're there.

681
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,635
That ain't the point.

682
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,140
The point is if your partner pages you ...

683
00:47:10,243 --> 00:47:12,074
you might want to get back to your partner.

684
00:47:12,178 --> 00:47:14,612
I want to meet the man who whupped your ass.

685
00:47:14,747 --> 00:47:18,080
I want to meet who whupped Shaft's ass.

686
00:47:18,184 --> 00:47:21,620
Look at me, man. You don't know what I've been through.

687
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:25,282
My wife kicked me out of the house,
kicked me out of my happy home.

688
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:29,987
But you got to go off by your self. "I got this, partner."

689
00:47:30,096 --> 00:47:32,121
Bullshit.

690
00:47:32,265 --> 00:47:34,165
I am feeling much better, though, thank you.

691
00:47:34,267 --> 00:47:36,098
- Yeah. - And I'll get his ass.

692
00:47:37,937 --> 00:47:40,167
Be cool. Watch your self.

693
00:47:40,273 --> 00:47:43,674
What did I say? Did you hear what I said?

694
00:47:43,776 --> 00:47:46,506
I heard what I said 'cause I was
standing there when I said it.

695
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:50,742
I told you to secure a witness.

696
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:54,616
Not to shoot up a neighborhood!
Not to do another dead body!

697
00:47:54,721 --> 00:47:57,315
Just get the dope back, and do it quietly.

698
00:47:57,423 --> 00:48:01,018
Look, Captain, this whole situation is getting out of control.

699
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,186
- You're goddamn right! - Look, man...

700
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:08,027
I damn near had to pass a pop
quiz before she believed I was him.

701
00:48:09,268 --> 00:48:12,704
Going, going... Shit. A little off.

702
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:15,137
I haven't killed anybody yet today, Captain.

703
00:48:15,274 --> 00:48:18,175
Do you want me to yell at you ? I can do that.

704
00:48:18,277 --> 00:48:23,340
Let me tell you something. This
witness is my only good news.

705
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:26,941
You guys are bad news. So what does that mean?

706
00:48:27,086 --> 00:48:30,180
Lf you have to be Mike Lowrey, Santa Claus, FD Hutton...

707
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:32,257
that's what you're gonna be!

708
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:35,054
Wait a minute. What the hell is going on here?

709
00:48:37,196 --> 00:48:39,994
I was getting them all in before you showed up.

710
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:43,262
Can somebody talk to me, please?
Can I know what's going on?

711
00:48:43,369 --> 00:48:48,238
Captain, these fools could have got
a look at my license plate last night.

712
00:48:48,307 --> 00:48:50,366
Where's the girl now?

713
00:48:52,278 --> 00:48:54,246
- His place. - What?

714
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,043
You left her by herself? Our only fucking witness?

715
00:48:58,151 --> 00:49:00,346
You left a strange hooker alone in my apartment?

716
00:49:00,486 --> 00:49:04,081
The girl is not a hooker, as far as I know.

717
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:07,717
I had to stash her somewhere; her
and her dogs, Luke and Dukie.

718
00:49:07,827 --> 00:49:10,227
So you left dogs in my house?

719
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:12,695
There's dogs and a hooker in my house?

720
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:15,267
How about you add some chimps? We can have a carnival.

721
00:49:15,401 --> 00:49:17,062
I said she isn't a hooker.

722
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:19,161
- Can you please... - Shut up!

723
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,200
For years, Sinclair has been up my
ass, trying to pin something on me.

724
00:49:24,343 --> 00:49:26,937
I'm always taking it for you . Do it for me!

725
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:33,214
If we get this witness to identify the shooters...

726
00:49:33,352 --> 00:49:35,115
maybe we catch our bad guys.

727
00:49:35,221 --> 00:49:40,181
But until then, you are Mike Lowrey.

728
00:49:40,326 --> 00:49:42,453
You be him. That's what you are. You're him.

729
00:49:42,595 --> 00:49:44,927
I don't want to hear it. And you ...

730
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:48,262
You're you . You be you , but not in front of her.

731
00:49:48,367 --> 00:49:49,834
You're him! You're you!

732
00:49:54,907 --> 00:49:58,809
Can we get a time-out, Captain?
Am I the designated homeless?

733
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:00,936
Does it look like I care?

734
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,776
Whatever it takes, all right?

735
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:07,113
What did she say to you ? The shooters
are making their drop in four days?

736
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,710
So we got four days.

737
00:50:08,821 --> 00:50:12,313
Captain, what kind of plan is that?

738
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:14,551
I can't be shacked up with that woman.

739
00:50:14,694 --> 00:50:18,221
I have a family to look after. My wife will kill my ass!

740
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:21,164
You don't like your job? Quit.

741
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,002
Damn!

742
00:50:26,405 --> 00:50:29,966
Look, I'll stay at the house with Theresa and the kids.

743
00:50:30,109 --> 00:50:31,974
Thank you , but no thanks.

744
00:50:32,111 --> 00:50:34,170
You wouldn't last five minutes with my family.

745
00:50:34,313 --> 00:50:38,215
Please, married life is easy. You
only got one woman to satisfy.

746
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:43,382
Yo, man. We ain't the Cosbys.

747
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:45,980
Let's go. I got this.

748
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:47,490
Go.

749
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:52,263
Every body wants to be like Mike.

750
00:50:52,398 --> 00:50:55,492
Yeah, and you're gonna be retired like him too.

751
00:50:55,601 --> 00:50:57,831
I'd have dunked it on your ass.

752
00:50:58,938 --> 00:51:01,236
Cleveland? I have never...

753
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,338
Look, woman, I done told you.

754
00:51:05,444 --> 00:51:06,934
It's a federal subpoena.

755
00:51:07,046 --> 00:51:08,445
Am I supposed to tell them no?

756
00:51:08,548 --> 00:51:11,142
I don't know what you'll tell them. Why can't he go?

757
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,185
- Why can't you go? - I wanted to...

758
00:51:14,287 --> 00:51:16,847
but Captain Howard said I'm irresponsible.

759
00:51:16,956 --> 00:51:20,824
No, he said, "A loose cannon,"
because I've been shooting in public.

760
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,863
- Out of now here sometimes.
- Mike! No, man. Please.

761
00:51:27,567 --> 00:51:30,730
Look, baby, the neighborhood has had a lot of break-ins.

762
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,735
I can handle it. I don't need Mike to handle it.

763
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,706
I know you can handle it, but I'm worrying about me.

764
00:51:35,808 --> 00:51:39,244
Mike's going to stay here with you
and the kids, take care of y'all...

765
00:51:39,345 --> 00:51:40,812
just till I come back.

766
00:51:40,947 --> 00:51:43,711
Who will pick the kids up from day care and all that?

767
00:51:43,816 --> 00:51:47,252
- Mike can't do it. - Are you listening to me? I said...

768
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:51,484
I read a book that could probably help y'all. I saw it on...

769
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:54,151
Mike, can you go down and have a Coke and a smile?

770
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,728
- Please? - All right.

771
00:51:57,930 --> 00:51:59,363
Y'all want something?

772
00:52:00,499 --> 00:52:02,262
Bring me a Coke.

773
00:52:02,368 --> 00:52:04,802
- Baby, you want a Coke? - I'm fine, thank you.

774
00:52:06,505 --> 00:52:08,063
All right.

775
00:52:13,212 --> 00:52:15,737
So Explain it to me, Elliot.

776
00:52:15,848 --> 00:52:17,782
We've got a problem with our chemistry set?

777
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:19,283
It's not a chemistry set.

778
00:52:19,418 --> 00:52:22,285
He knows it ain't a chemistry set, asshole.

779
00:52:27,126 --> 00:52:28,593
What is it?

780
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,721
The cutting agent is a highlyvolatile substance.

781
00:52:32,832 --> 00:52:36,700
- The ether... - I don't care.

782
00:52:36,836 --> 00:52:39,430
I'm not a fucking chemistry teacher.

783
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,439
- What is the problem? - There's too much moisture here.

784
00:52:44,543 --> 00:52:47,944
- Yeah, it's totally fucked. - You shut up!

785
00:52:50,216 --> 00:52:51,615
What else?

786
00:52:51,717 --> 00:52:54,447
It's taking longer to cook than we originally planned.

787
00:52:54,553 --> 00:52:57,522
If we rush it, we'll have a lot of drugs we can't sell.

788
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,787
You're fucking with my timetable. I gave you a deadline.

789
00:53:00,893 --> 00:53:03,885
- Do you understand? - Yeah, I understand.

790
00:53:09,068 --> 00:53:10,433
Yeah.

791
00:53:14,907 --> 00:53:17,842
- You dressed? - Yeah. I am.

792
00:53:19,078 --> 00:53:21,808
Look, we have to go through some mug shots.

793
00:53:21,914 --> 00:53:24,542
I'll hook into the computer. We can do this.

794
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:27,050
Mike, who's the guy in all the photographs?

795
00:53:29,722 --> 00:53:32,088
Sometimes I don't even look at my shelves.

796
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:34,284
I forget all the pictures were here.

797
00:53:34,393 --> 00:53:38,420
That's my partner, Marcus Burnett.

798
00:53:38,531 --> 00:53:41,864
I've never seen anything like this before.

799
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,937
I can see how it may throw you a little bit.

800
00:53:45,037 --> 00:53:46,664
It's a cop thing.

801
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:50,003
These pictures are up here for every time he saved my life.

802
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:54,671
Lf you go to his place ain't nothing but pictures of me.

803
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,248
It's like a shrine. Just a reminder.

804
00:53:58,784 --> 00:54:02,117
Because when I saw it, and it was the whole wall...

805
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:05,213
I thought maybe they were pictures of your lover.

806
00:54:05,324 --> 00:54:09,055
- Of who? - I thought maybe you were gay.

807
00:54:10,629 --> 00:54:14,725
That I was gay? No, baby.

808
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:19,464
I didn't mean to offend you . It's okay to be a homosexual.

809
00:54:19,572 --> 00:54:23,030
You're not listening. It's not registering.

810
00:54:23,142 --> 00:54:25,372
Believe me. Did you sleep in the bed?

811
00:54:25,478 --> 00:54:29,312
Didn't you feel the dents? The dents come from all that.

812
00:54:29,415 --> 00:54:30,973
That's how I get down.

813
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:33,711
That's sweet.

814
00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:35,719
Gay.

815
00:54:35,821 --> 00:54:38,119
If I was, I'd change the drapes in this motherfucker.

816
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,120
No

817
00:54:45,998 --> 00:54:50,059
- Want some? - No, thanks. I don't eat flesh.

818
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:52,831
What?

819
00:54:52,938 --> 00:54:56,738
That's flesh that you're shoveling into your mouth.

820
00:54:56,842 --> 00:54:59,902
That was a living, breathing creature.

821
00:55:00,012 --> 00:55:02,242
It probably had a name.

822
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:05,383
It's just baloney.

823
00:55:05,484 --> 00:55:07,714
My baloney has a first name.

824
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,256
Actually, your baloney has about 30 names...

825
00:55:11,357 --> 00:55:14,918
because they take odd parts from all different ones...

826
00:55:15,027 --> 00:55:18,895
Like the leftovers: The hooves and stomach lining...

827
00:55:18,998 --> 00:55:20,397
ears, stuff like that.

828
00:55:20,499 --> 00:55:24,367
They put it into this machine and grind it all up.

829
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:27,439
Then out comes this sheet.

830
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,634
That's what you're eating now.

831
00:55:30,635 --> 00:55:31,635
Okey.

832
00:55:33,479 --> 00:55:36,243
You know what? I won't eat baloney no more.

833
00:55:36,348 --> 00:55:39,613
How about a pickle? Can I eat it?

834
00:55:39,718 --> 00:55:42,448
It has a lot of salt, but it's fine. It is a vegetable.

835
00:55:42,555 --> 00:55:46,787
A lot of salt in the pickle? Let me rinse it off.

836
00:55:46,892 --> 00:55:49,019
There we go.

837
00:55:51,063 --> 00:55:52,553
How's that?

838
00:55:52,665 --> 00:55:56,965
- Just keep going. - I don't even taste the salt now.

839
00:56:00,339 --> 00:56:02,068
Go back.

840
00:56:08,614 --> 00:56:10,081
That's the guy.

841
00:56:10,182 --> 00:56:12,343
He was there in the room.

842
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:16,888
We got a tip they were running major
drugs, something like 50 keys.

843
00:56:16,989 --> 00:56:18,923
So we step to the door. Boom!

844
00:56:19,024 --> 00:56:21,857
Freeze! Miami Police Department! Get down!

845
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:26,989
Out of now here, this little crazy pimp
named Chino punched me in the head.

846
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:27,990
with some brass knuckles, right?

847
00:56:27,099 --> 00:56:29,761
Chino had been running whores.
Your dad will explain that to you.

848
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:33,828
Look at it. Your dogs are shitting all over my place.

849
00:56:33,939 --> 00:56:35,497
Liquid shit.

850
00:56:35,608 --> 00:56:39,840
It doesn't help when you shell ack
it in with furniture polish.

851
00:56:39,945 --> 00:56:41,970
There's a piece right there. Please, get that.

852
00:56:42,081 --> 00:56:44,515
- Fine. - It looks like a chip of shit.

853
00:56:46,886 --> 00:56:49,821
Can I please have the parole jacket on Noah Trafficante?

854
00:56:49,922 --> 00:56:51,787
- Thank you . - You know what?

855
00:56:51,891 --> 00:56:53,825
I'm getting tired of this witness.

856
00:56:53,926 --> 00:56:56,827
I want to get back to my life the way it was.

857
00:56:56,929 --> 00:57:00,421
I'm tired. I got married so I could stop lying.

858
00:57:00,533 --> 00:57:02,433
I cannot believe you're complaining.

859
00:57:02,535 --> 00:57:06,471
You got it easy compared to me,
living in that zoo you call home.

860
00:57:06,572 --> 00:57:08,972
Why you have to call my place a zoo?

861
00:57:09,074 --> 00:57:10,871
- I'm tired of you talkin' that stuff, man.
- You want to fight me.

862
00:57:10,976 --> 00:57:14,036
- Don't call my place a zoo. - Listen... Francine, please...

863
00:57:16,815 --> 00:57:21,309
- That's my silk shirt, man! - Yeah, it is kind of nice.

864
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,413
Since I'm gonna be like Mike, I
might as well dress like Mike.

865
00:57:25,524 --> 00:57:29,221
I wanna be like Mike

866
00:57:30,663 --> 00:57:33,723
You're sick. Something is wrong with you.

867
00:57:33,832 --> 00:57:35,732
You have a problem, and you should have your self checked.

868
00:57:35,834 --> 00:57:37,495
Yeah. Probably.

869
00:57:39,338 --> 00:57:42,535
- Here's the file. He works at Club Hell. - Thank you.

870
00:57:42,641 --> 00:57:44,575
Take care of this, please.

871
00:57:44,677 --> 00:57:47,669
- I've got to call the wife. - Whose wife?

872
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:50,180
Can you please do some work?

873
00:57:50,282 --> 00:57:52,773
One time today, just do something.

874
00:57:52,885 --> 00:57:56,082
- Do something that helps this case. - Boy...

875
00:57:56,188 --> 00:57:58,247
You look real handsome today.

876
00:57:58,357 --> 00:58:00,587
See, it's not that kind of day.

877
00:58:00,693 --> 00:58:02,923
Leave me the fuck alone.

878
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:04,757
Seriously. All right?

879
00:58:04,863 --> 00:58:08,799
- What's up? PMS? - Damn the jokes.

880
00:58:08,901 --> 00:58:11,233
Ring it. I ain't in the mood.

881
00:58:11,337 --> 00:58:13,430
Yeah, that's cool. Hold on.

882
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:15,598
All right. Write it down.

883
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:17,107
Go ahead.

884
00:58:19,745 --> 00:58:21,736
All right.

885
00:58:21,847 --> 00:58:25,943
- How are things going with the
kids? - They're fine. You okay?

886
00:58:26,051 --> 00:58:30,044
- How's potty training going? - Slowly but surely.

887
00:58:30,155 --> 00:58:32,783
- You are so silly. - Are you going to be late tonight?

888
00:58:32,891 --> 00:58:35,951
It will be 10:30, 11:00 before I get in.

889
00:58:36,061 --> 00:58:39,895
- Later. - Don't wait up. I'll be all right.

890
00:58:43,736 --> 00:58:47,797
Why don't you rent a movie?
Something we can kick back to.

891
00:58:50,075 --> 00:58:53,135
- What you wearing? - Give me the phone!

892
00:58:53,245 --> 00:58:55,805
- Baby! - She hung up a long time ago.

893
00:58:55,914 --> 00:58:57,814
I was playing.

894
00:58:59,018 --> 00:59:00,417
Hello?

895
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:01,418
I was playing.

896
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,648
Hey, man, don't play like that.

897
00:59:04,757 --> 00:59:06,486
That's my family. Don't break up a happy home.

898
00:59:06,592 --> 00:59:08,219
Stop wearing my clothes then.

899
00:59:11,697 --> 00:59:15,497
Everybody's about the jokes today, ain't they? Hello?

900
00:59:15,601 --> 00:59:17,967
I cannot believe this.

901
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:21,597
This Eddie Dominguez file cannot be that hard to get into.

902
00:59:21,707 --> 00:59:24,005
I've tried three times. I just can't get in.

903
00:59:24,109 --> 00:59:26,043
Besides, this is illegal.

904
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:28,170
Yeah, that never stopped you before.

905
00:59:29,448 --> 00:59:31,109
Just let me know if you get anything.

906
00:59:31,216 --> 00:59:34,515
Anything for you , but I can't get in. I tried.

907
00:59:47,533 --> 00:59:49,194
What's up, Chet?

908
00:59:54,606 --> 00:59:56,631
The Lowrey Brothers.

909
00:59:56,775 --> 01:00:00,370
Let's just get down to Club Hell and pick up Noah.

910
01:00:00,479 --> 01:00:03,380
Julie, it's me.

911
01:00:03,482 --> 01:00:06,451
You're supposed to be getting us
into this Eddie Dominguez file.

912
01:00:06,552 --> 01:00:09,043
It's gonna be a day or two before I can get Fletch out.

913
01:00:09,154 --> 01:00:12,646
- We don't have a day or two. - I'm not the computerwhiz.

914
01:00:12,758 --> 01:00:14,658
It's gonna take a while before we can hack the computer.

915
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,252
- You're not taking care of shit. - Mike,
I was thinking about something...

916
01:00:19,431 --> 01:00:21,058
Hi.

917
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:24,226
- You must be Marcus. - I'm Marcus.

918
01:00:24,336 --> 01:00:26,861
- That's right. - Right.

919
01:00:27,005 --> 01:00:28,836
I'm Julie.

920
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:31,501
Julie. All right. It's nice to meet you.

921
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:36,673
You too. I recognize you from every one of the photographs.

922
01:00:36,782 --> 01:00:39,512
Yeah. He's my man, so we...

923
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:44,352
All those on the wall.

924
01:00:44,456 --> 01:00:46,890
- Yeah. - You must be very good.

925
01:00:46,992 --> 01:00:48,960
I'm sorry?

926
01:00:49,061 --> 01:00:52,588
As a partner. Given what your job, what you do.

927
01:00:52,698 --> 01:00:56,293
What time are we doing this thing tonight?

928
01:00:56,435 --> 01:00:58,630
- Excuse me? - Mike said we were going to a club.

929
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:04,600
Yeah. "We" as in me and my partner.

930
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:07,941
You wanted home protective custody. You're at my house.

931
01:01:08,046 --> 01:01:09,707
That's just great.

932
01:01:09,815 --> 01:01:12,375
So I'll just stay here again...

933
01:01:12,484 --> 01:01:14,748
with Chet the mini-moron doorman to protect me?

934
01:01:14,853 --> 01:01:16,548
Chet is very good.

935
01:01:16,655 --> 01:01:20,147
I'm sorry. That looks like a stain on your rug.

936
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,591
- Damn. - That was my baby, Luke.

937
01:01:22,694 --> 01:01:25,822
He gets kind of nervous in new surroundings.

938
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:28,058
- He just shits, huh? - Yeah.

939
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:32,126
It's like marking his territory. It's sort of a male thing.

940
01:01:32,237 --> 01:01:35,229
I offered to pay Mike for the
cleaning, and he wouldn't hear of it.

941
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,900
- I'm getting rid of it. - Yeah, you don't need that.

942
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:41,173
I'm throwing that out anyway. I just want a new look.

943
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,181
Mike is a special guy. Boy, Mike is special.

944
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:46,683
I call him "Special Mike."

945
01:01:46,785 --> 01:01:49,982
It's funny how you can just laugh at that.

946
01:01:50,088 --> 01:01:52,420
That's why I love him. Now, me?

947
01:01:52,524 --> 01:01:55,550
I'd be pissed.

948
01:01:57,095 --> 01:02:01,498
- Look at this cute dog on the couch. - That's Luke.

949
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:06,003
- Look how he crawls on the leather. -
You want to meet Duke? He's in bed.

950
01:02:06,104 --> 01:02:09,130
He's been feeling upset and having diarrhea...

951
01:02:09,241 --> 01:02:10,936
and throwing up all morning.

952
01:02:11,043 --> 01:02:12,510
Oh, baby.

953
01:02:12,644 --> 01:02:15,875
Let's go see if little Duke is gonna be okay, shall we?

954
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:24,087
Me and you.

955
01:02:24,088 --> 01:02:25,088
Oh, Mike.

956
01:02:27,793 --> 01:02:30,353
- Lady, who are you ? - Who the hell are you?

957
01:02:30,462 --> 01:02:33,192
- You have to get out. - Get your hands off me!

958
01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:35,528
- Lady, don't push me! - I'm Yvette.

959
01:02:35,634 --> 01:02:38,865
- You're not any Yvette I know. - What are you doing?

960
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:40,871
Get out of here, all right?

961
01:02:40,973 --> 01:02:45,910
Lf you don't stop stalking me, I'll
arrest your ass, you old psycho!

962
01:02:46,011 --> 01:02:50,038
- You asshole! - Woman's into some weird shit.

963
01:02:50,148 --> 01:02:52,810
- What is going on out here? - Excuse me.

964
01:02:52,951 --> 01:02:54,885
That was crazy Yvette...

965
01:02:54,987 --> 01:02:56,887
stalking me.

966
01:02:58,323 --> 01:03:01,417
Yvette? I forgot she was coming. You threw her out?

967
01:03:06,899 --> 01:03:09,163
Yvette is a masseuse.

968
01:03:12,504 --> 01:03:15,132
She massages shit.

969
01:03:15,274 --> 01:03:17,708
- She told me. - Listen...

970
01:03:17,809 --> 01:03:20,539
are there any other totally hysterical...

971
01:03:20,679 --> 01:03:24,547
half-naked women popping by
tonight that I should know about?

972
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:27,778
- She was naked? - Titties were out a little bit.

973
01:03:27,886 --> 01:03:29,251
You threw Yvette out naked?

974
01:03:32,024 --> 01:03:35,755
You're something... My wife would
hate... She hates womanizers.

975
01:03:38,497 --> 01:03:41,728
- There's something wrong with you . - There is?

976
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:44,267
You don't respect other people's
shit. I've told you that for years.

977
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:47,634
Ever since we started, you always have your trash all over.

978
01:03:47,739 --> 01:03:49,502
Enough! Please!

979
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:52,076
Me and my partner...

980
01:03:52,177 --> 01:03:55,772
are going to Club Hell to bust this fool Noah.

981
01:03:55,881 --> 01:03:57,712
Does anybody have a problem with that?

982
01:03:57,816 --> 01:03:59,443
Fine.

983
01:04:01,086 --> 01:04:02,883
Don't blow the case.

984
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:16,291
Frank, here's the deal: You stay put.
Anybody tells you to move, don't.

985
01:04:16,401 --> 01:04:20,428
Tell them you're making a delivery
for Mr. Fouchet. You got it?

986
01:04:20,572 --> 01:04:24,099
Jeez. It's ether! It will explode!

987
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:26,200
You dope!

988
01:04:26,345 --> 01:04:29,280
Don't even breathe, you knucklehead!

989
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:45,893
I remember you.

990
01:05:04,049 --> 01:05:09,351
Check it. We got two days left. Let's try to do this right.

991
01:05:09,454 --> 01:05:12,150
No gunshots, no dead bodies.

992
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:14,224
I'm not trying to lose my job on this one.

993
01:05:14,326 --> 01:05:17,818
If I recall correctly, the last couple
dead bad guys belonged to you.

994
01:05:17,963 --> 01:05:20,363
And next time you have to kill them...

995
01:05:20,465 --> 01:05:22,763
do it after you get the information we need.

996
01:05:22,901 --> 01:05:24,562
That's just a suggestion.

997
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,662
Please. You ain't even trying to compare body counts.

998
01:05:27,806 --> 01:05:31,537
One... Should I keep going? Damn, I'm out.

999
01:05:33,745 --> 01:05:36,305
This guy Noah's parole jacket says he works in there.

1000
01:05:36,415 --> 01:05:39,543
We're standing out front arguing
like a couple of school girls.

1001
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:41,812
Why don't we put an end to all this bickering?

1002
01:05:41,953 --> 01:05:45,514
- All right. - ' Cause you're getting on my nerves.

1003
01:06:10,048 --> 01:06:14,985
- Look at you . Can you stay focused? - What? I'm focused!

1004
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:18,079
Yeah, focused on all this scattered ass here.

1005
01:06:18,223 --> 01:06:20,623
Let's do what we came to do and get out of here.

1006
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:23,388
- Simple. - Fine. Let's split up, check around.

1007
01:06:23,495 --> 01:06:25,827
- Meet me at the bar in ten minutes. - Fine.

1008
01:06:31,536 --> 01:06:35,529
Holy shit. What the hell is he doing? Man!

1009
01:06:35,674 --> 01:06:38,040
That's the cop! There he is! See him?

1010
01:06:38,143 --> 01:06:40,441
- That's him! - Yeah, I'm going!

1011
01:06:49,054 --> 01:06:50,988
What's up?

1012
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:56,257
Budweiser. Feel like I had a million of them.

1013
01:07:07,906 --> 01:07:09,999
What's up, motherfucker?

1014
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:26,523
Tell me where the dough is, jack-off!

1015
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:03,384
Fuck!

1016
01:08:12,938 --> 01:08:16,999
Next time learn how to work the safety with your punk ass!

1017
01:08:17,142 --> 01:08:18,541
I'll be back.

1018
01:08:26,985 --> 01:08:32,150
- Who whupped your ass now? -
This really ain't the fucking time.

1019
01:08:32,257 --> 01:08:34,885
They know. Let's get Noah and get out of here.

1020
01:08:50,675 --> 01:08:53,235
The chick!

1021
01:08:53,345 --> 01:08:55,711
The girl! The bitch from the rooftop!

1022
01:08:55,712 --> 01:08:56,712
Julie!

1023
01:09:38,223 --> 01:09:40,657
- Let's go! - That was the guy who shot Max!

1024
01:09:47,632 --> 01:09:48,189
The truck! Let's take the truck!

1025
01:09:50,568 --> 01:09:51,933
Right there!

1026
01:09:52,037 --> 01:09:55,700
Move! Move! Move! Move!

1027
01:09:55,701 --> 01:09:56,701
We're really in a hurry.

1028
01:09:57,842 --> 01:10:00,777
- Let's go! - You're cops! Why are we running away?

1029
01:10:00,879 --> 01:10:03,871
- He's in there! - Here! Go!

1030
01:10:13,825 --> 01:10:16,817
This is good. Noah's chasing us!

1031
01:10:16,928 --> 01:10:21,297
What was that?

1032
01:10:21,399 --> 01:10:23,663
That was- - I don' t know.

1033
01:10:23,802 --> 01:10:27,829
But I had a good shot at him if your
friend Action Jackson over here...

1034
01:10:30,241 --> 01:10:32,266
This is official police business!

1035
01:10:32,377 --> 01:10:33,969
You had no business in there!

1036
01:10:34,112 --> 01:10:36,808
And can you please drive this thing?

1037
01:10:36,915 --> 01:10:39,281
Don't bring it here, all right?

1038
01:10:39,384 --> 01:10:41,716
You picked this slow-ass ice cream truck!

1039
01:10:43,521 --> 01:10:45,819
- What am I smelling? - Just drive!

1040
01:10:47,292 --> 01:10:50,853
Ether. Extremely flammable ether.

1041
01:10:50,962 --> 01:10:53,624
- Shit. - Goddamn.

1042
01:10:53,732 --> 01:10:56,667
You the man! You the fucking man tonight!

1043
01:10:56,768 --> 01:10:59,896
You pick an ice cream truck that's a damn bomb!

1044
01:11:03,908 --> 01:11:06,172
Shit!

1045
01:11:06,277 --> 01:11:10,008
- This is protective custody? - Yes!

1046
01:11:10,009 --> 01:11:11,009
- Oh!
- Shit!

1047
01:11:33,438 --> 01:11:35,736
You better do something, boy! We're running out of road!

1048
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,671
Who picked this road?

1049
01:11:37,776 --> 01:11:40,404
All the road in Miami, and you're running out of it!

1050
01:11:40,512 --> 01:11:44,949
- You better get an idea fast! - Why
are the ideas always up to me?

1051
01:11:57,829 --> 01:12:01,788
- Take this shit! - It's a dead end! There's no more road!

1052
01:12:10,708 --> 01:12:12,676
We're out of fucking road!

1053
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:19,910
- Motherfucker's gonna blow! - Get the fuck out!

1054
01:12:19,911 --> 01:12:20,911
Well.

1055
01:12:36,701 --> 01:12:38,999
Should I add this to your body count?

1056
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:44,099
There goes our only lead to the dope.

1057
01:12:44,209 --> 01:12:47,269
Ain't this a bitch?

1058
01:12:47,378 --> 01:12:49,437
"The dope"?

1059
01:12:50,548 --> 01:12:52,516
What are you talking about?

1060
01:12:52,617 --> 01:12:55,108
How about there goes our only lead to Max's killer?

1061
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:56,949
He's still out there.

1062
01:12:58,389 --> 01:12:59,947
But that's not really important.

1063
01:13:00,058 --> 01:13:02,822
It's not like it's your job to protect people. Holy shit.

1064
01:13:02,927 --> 01:13:04,986
- She's crazy. - I'm crazy?

1065
01:13:09,334 --> 01:13:11,131
- You're gone! - I'm out of here!

1066
01:13:11,236 --> 01:13:13,136
- What is wrong with you ? Stop!
- She done fucking zoomed!

1067
01:13:13,238 --> 01:13:16,901
- This is the witness! - That's it. You deal with her.

1068
01:13:17,008 --> 01:13:18,635
- No way. - Listen.

1069
01:13:18,743 --> 01:13:21,109
- Bullshit. - Yes, you're right.

1070
01:13:21,212 --> 01:13:24,807
This started because of missing
drugs, but let me tell you something.

1071
01:13:24,916 --> 01:13:29,182
There is absolutely nothing more important to Mike...

1072
01:13:29,287 --> 01:13:31,915
than doing this guy that killed Max.

1073
01:13:33,024 --> 01:13:37,017
I know he has a hard time expressing his feelings.

1074
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:42,331
Come on. It will be all right, okay?

1075
01:13:42,433 --> 01:13:44,333
We need you.

1076
01:13:44,435 --> 01:13:46,596
Part of the team.

1077
01:13:46,704 --> 01:13:49,537
I thought he was supposed to be the smooth one.

1078
01:13:51,643 --> 01:13:55,340
- This has not been a good day.
- Damn right. This is bullshit.

1079
01:13:55,446 --> 01:13:57,676
We got two days to find these fools...

1080
01:13:57,782 --> 01:14:01,183
and we got no leads because you
cooked Noah's ass on the freeway.

1081
01:14:05,123 --> 01:14:07,523
- Shampoo? - Hello.

1082
01:14:08,626 --> 01:14:10,856
- There. - Let's do that.

1083
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,529
What's up?

1084
01:14:18,303 --> 01:14:21,534
It don't take that long to get shampoo.

1085
01:14:21,639 --> 01:14:23,698
- Please, let's go. - Look at this.

1086
01:14:23,808 --> 01:14:25,639
"Animal tested."

1087
01:14:25,743 --> 01:14:28,541
Do you know how many chemicals are in this stuff?

1088
01:14:28,646 --> 01:14:31,615
I don't care if you go bald. Just get it and let's go.

1089
01:14:32,817 --> 01:14:35,308
He is a chemist.

1090
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:37,320
That's entirely too much heroin and too much ether...

1091
01:14:37,422 --> 01:14:38,980
for nobody to know nothing.

1092
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:40,887
What is he talking about?

1093
01:14:40,992 --> 01:14:44,155
You know the barrels of ether that
blew up on the ice cream truck?

1094
01:14:44,262 --> 01:14:46,355
They were going to use that to process the heroin.

1095
01:14:46,464 --> 01:14:49,228
Yeah, they do that to cut it. It quadruples the value.

1096
01:14:49,334 --> 01:14:51,894
Yeah, you can't just stick it in the microwave.

1097
01:14:52,003 --> 01:14:54,267
Maybe you're onto something.
Let's just pay for this, all right?

1098
01:14:58,343 --> 01:15:00,834
- How much is that? - Fourteen twenty-five.

1099
01:15:00,945 --> 01:15:03,243
Damn. I must have left my wallet somewhere.

1100
01:15:03,348 --> 01:15:08,547
Freeze, mother bitches! Don't you move.

1101
01:15:08,653 --> 01:15:11,213
- I'm not understanding. I really don't. - Shut up!

1102
01:15:11,322 --> 01:15:16,419
- Do you just attract violent people? - Take it easy, all right?

1103
01:15:16,527 --> 01:15:19,758
- We are police officers. - You're not police officers.

1104
01:15:19,864 --> 01:15:23,265
- I'm not stupid. I've seen police. - What are you?

1105
01:15:23,368 --> 01:15:28,135
- I'm going to reach for my badge.
- You want badges, mother bitch?

1106
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:29,900
I give you badges! Here!

1107
01:15:30,008 --> 01:15:32,568
Ninety-nine cents each! I sell you some!

1108
01:15:32,677 --> 01:15:35,578
You got eight badges! I told you this cop thing don't work.

1109
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,706
I blow you ! Then I blow you!

1110
01:15:38,816 --> 01:15:41,717
Blow me? What the fuck? Hump me. That's all right.

1111
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:45,220
I'm from the Middle East! I kill before. I kill again!

1112
01:15:45,356 --> 01:15:48,723
- Fuck me, please! Hold on! - No, you hold on!

1113
01:15:48,826 --> 01:15:50,817
Do you see the emotion I'm going through now?

1114
01:15:50,928 --> 01:15:52,828
That means this shit is serious.

1115
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:56,559
Me and this mother fucker's not vibing
right now. That's what that means.

1116
01:15:56,668 --> 01:15:59,728
- You got something on your
chest? - That's what I'm saying!

1117
01:15:59,837 --> 01:16:03,102
- Hello? The guy has got a cannon. - What do you want?

1118
01:16:03,207 --> 01:16:05,505
- Do you want some? Come get some. - I want some!

1119
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:07,601
- I'm gone. - Freeze, bitch!

1120
01:16:07,712 --> 01:16:12,843
- You freeze, bitch! - Oh, shit. I'm fucked.

1121
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:15,976
Now back up, put the gun down...

1122
01:16:16,087 --> 01:16:19,284
and give me a pack of Tropical Fruit Bubblicious.

1123
01:16:19,390 --> 01:16:21,483
And some Skittles.

1124
01:16:25,596 --> 01:16:28,463
Hell of a night. I'm going to bed.

1125
01:16:28,566 --> 01:16:33,026
So make your self at home. It's your bed.

1126
01:16:34,205 --> 01:16:37,072
I'll sit down for a minute...

1127
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:39,837
'cause I'm guarding shit, you know.

1128
01:16:39,944 --> 01:16:42,504
I'm watching out for the bad boys.

1129
01:16:42,613 --> 01:16:45,980
I can see things, you know...

1130
01:16:46,084 --> 01:16:47,847
real well from my "peripheals."

1131
01:16:47,952 --> 01:16:49,852
You know, for such a stud, Mike Lowrey...

1132
01:16:49,954 --> 01:16:55,187
you sure seem a little rigid about having a girl in your bed.

1133
01:16:55,293 --> 01:16:57,853
Who? Me? Mike Lowrey?

1134
01:16:57,962 --> 01:17:01,693
I'm not rigid. I'm comfortable.

1135
01:17:01,799 --> 01:17:03,858
This is my bed.

1136
01:17:03,968 --> 01:17:06,766
- Why would I be uncomfortable? - I don't know.

1137
01:17:06,871 --> 01:17:12,400
I think it's more than just wired.
Maybe it was all the guns and stuff.

1138
01:17:12,543 --> 01:17:17,037
I've never really shot a gun
before, and that's... All that steel.

1139
01:17:17,148 --> 01:17:21,551
I'm feeling... Don't you feel a little funny?

1140
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:26,716
- I'm not a comedian, but... - I don't mean that kind of funny.

1141
01:17:26,824 --> 01:17:29,918
I mean like funny.

1142
01:17:37,335 --> 01:17:40,327
Now, you don't want that.

1143
01:17:42,006 --> 01:17:43,667
'Cause when I come...

1144
01:17:43,775 --> 01:17:46,073
I come with the thunder.

1145
01:17:46,177 --> 01:17:50,204
You sound like you're saving your self for marriage.

1146
01:17:53,518 --> 01:17:56,749
That ain't me. That's Marcus.

1147
01:17:56,854 --> 01:17:59,186
You know what I'm saying? He's the married one.

1148
01:18:00,358 --> 01:18:02,417
I got some other... Oh, no.

1149
01:18:02,527 --> 01:18:06,088
I've seen it now. Turn the page, girl.

1150
01:18:06,089 --> 01:18:07,089
Turn the page, girl. I done already seen it.

1151
01:18:09,534 --> 01:18:11,934
Don't laugh.

1152
01:18:12,036 --> 01:18:14,266
I cannot believe he wore his Afro that big.

1153
01:18:14,372 --> 01:18:17,341
- I forgot all about that. - I think he looked cute like that.

1154
01:18:17,475 --> 01:18:19,966
What's Marcus's wife like?

1155
01:18:24,382 --> 01:18:25,849
She's like a wife.

1156
01:18:25,983 --> 01:18:31,046
I mean, she must be pretty
amazing to keep a guy like Marcus.

1157
01:18:35,059 --> 01:18:38,654
- Keep a guy like what? - Like watching him tonight...

1158
01:18:38,763 --> 01:18:42,096
He's very sort of take-charge.

1159
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,727
The way he was throwing guys this way and that.

1160
01:18:45,837 --> 01:18:48,135
There's something about him. I don't know what it is.

1161
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:50,639
He's so smooth, you know?

1162
01:18:50,741 --> 01:18:54,472
Boy, I bet his wife's...

1163
01:18:54,579 --> 01:18:58,174
enjoying the smoothness right this minute.

1164
01:19:00,251 --> 01:19:04,017
- He's got a quality women respond to. - Sure.

1165
01:19:04,121 --> 01:19:05,645
I can't imagine the kind of woman...

1166
01:19:05,756 --> 01:19:10,284
that wouldn't find Marcus attractive.

1167
01:19:10,428 --> 01:19:14,159
Probably couldn't be around him and just...

1168
01:19:14,265 --> 01:19:16,165
You know, like our situation.

1169
01:19:16,267 --> 01:19:19,998
- If two people were alone... - Not with a guy like that.

1170
01:19:20,104 --> 01:19:21,696
Excuse me.

1171
01:19:25,543 --> 01:19:28,979
What is wrong with him? This one
goes on the bulletin board at work.

1172
01:19:29,113 --> 01:19:31,308
Uh-uh. Don't do that.

1173
01:19:32,783 --> 01:19:35,616
Put it back in. I cannot be lieve you took it out.

1174
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:38,655
Come on. Marcus will kill us if he finds out. Give it to me.

1175
01:19:38,789 --> 01:19:40,620
I can't be lieve I let you see it.

1176
01:19:40,725 --> 01:19:42,215
Motherfucker!

1177
01:19:49,467 --> 01:19:50,900
Goddamn it.

1178
01:19:51,002 --> 01:19:55,200
Got some jewelry for you . I'm sorry, but damn that.

1179
01:19:55,306 --> 01:20:00,676
I think we need to address the serious
lack of trust in this relationship.

1180
01:20:00,778 --> 01:20:03,838
- Please. - I don't think this is legal.

1181
01:20:03,948 --> 01:20:09,545
I won't be long. It's legal. Out of sight.

1182
01:20:09,654 --> 01:20:13,556
Sanchez, this is Lowrey. Yeah, your mother. Listen.

1183
01:20:13,658 --> 01:20:16,183
These guys are about to make a move.

1184
01:20:16,294 --> 01:20:19,263
Blue convertible, two visible
occupants. Check it out, all right?

1185
01:20:25,403 --> 01:20:26,700
Here we go.

1186
01:20:26,804 --> 01:20:28,362
- Is that our guy? - That's him.

1187
01:20:28,506 --> 01:20:31,942
- Where's the girl? - I don't see any girl. There's no girl.

1188
01:20:37,848 --> 01:20:40,874
Fuck off, barking-ass dog. Shut up.

1189
01:20:43,688 --> 01:20:45,417
Sneak up on my own mother fuckin' house.

1190
01:20:47,024 --> 01:20:49,788
What in the world? Very strange.

1191
01:20:49,894 --> 01:20:53,125
His ass upstairs. Supposed to be my boy.

1192
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:54,857
You motherfucker.

1193
01:20:54,999 --> 01:20:57,058
Ducking and weaving up and down.

1194
01:20:57,201 --> 01:20:59,897
Look at this shit. Is this what you want?

1195
01:21:00,037 --> 01:21:02,437
Got me climbing like a chimp.

1196
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:05,031
But I ain't going out like that.

1197
01:21:05,142 --> 01:21:07,838
It don't take anybody that long to get into bed.

1198
01:21:09,413 --> 01:21:12,246
Got my babies in the house.

1199
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:14,648
Your man can't get no quality time...

1200
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:17,346
but my partner can get some quality time.

1201
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:18,581
I don't play that shit.

1202
01:21:27,365 --> 01:21:30,198
- There's somebody out there. - Quick, get the kids.

1203
01:21:32,269 --> 01:21:35,136
I knew it! I didn't have to call the fucking psychic line!

1204
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:36,467
Freeze!

1205
01:21:41,746 --> 01:21:44,476
- Move and you're a dead man! - Motherfucker!

1206
01:21:44,582 --> 01:21:47,847
Gun up to his head. They're going
to shoot each other. Unbelievable.

1207
01:21:47,952 --> 01:21:51,649
- Miami Police! Freeze! - I am the police!

1208
01:21:51,756 --> 01:21:53,883
- Marcus, what are you doing? - You're doing Theresa!

1209
01:21:53,991 --> 01:21:56,551
- I'm not! - Nobody does my baby!

1210
01:21:58,763 --> 01:22:01,926
We could sneak up and snuff them both right now.

1211
01:22:02,033 --> 01:22:03,557
Yeah, but we're supposed to get the girl. Forget them.

1212
01:22:03,701 --> 01:22:06,966
Never fuck with a cop's family, asshole.

1213
01:22:07,104 --> 01:22:09,834
- Doesn't that piss you off? - That pisses the fuck out of me.

1214
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:11,874
Don't get me started. Get out of the car.

1215
01:22:13,010 --> 01:22:16,275
Fuck it! Some shit is making you crazy.

1216
01:22:16,414 --> 01:22:19,383
You know there's nothing going
on between me and Theresa!

1217
01:22:19,384 --> 01:22:20,384
Shit.

1218
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:25,812
Man, I've been your partner for six years...

1219
01:22:25,923 --> 01:22:27,982
and I've been your boy all my life.

1220
01:22:28,125 --> 01:22:29,888
but you didn't even think that...

1221
01:22:30,027 --> 01:22:33,190
you didn't even let some dumb
shit like that creep up in you mind

1222
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:35,264
This is me! What is wrong with you?

1223
01:22:36,634 --> 01:22:39,102
It was just... I don't know.

1224
01:22:39,236 --> 01:22:41,670
I just...

1225
01:22:46,243 --> 01:22:48,177
Yeah, I'm fine.

1226
01:22:48,279 --> 01:22:50,679
Get the fuck out of here. Where's Julie?

1227
01:22:50,781 --> 01:22:53,306
She's in the car, handcuffed to the steering wheel.

1228
01:22:53,451 --> 01:22:55,476
Are you trying to blow this case?

1229
01:22:55,619 --> 01:22:57,712
My bad, man. I ain't had no quality time.

1230
01:22:57,855 --> 01:22:59,846
You know how that is. Sometimes you do dumb shit.

1231
01:22:59,957 --> 01:23:02,187
- Let's go. - That's all that is.

1232
01:23:04,662 --> 01:23:06,721
Yo, my bad.

1233
01:23:06,864 --> 01:23:08,695
It's cool.

1234
01:23:08,799 --> 01:23:12,030
Go. All right. Yeah.

1235
01:23:14,672 --> 01:23:16,697
These calls were made to Club Hell...

1236
01:23:16,841 --> 01:23:18,240
from this precinct.

1237
01:23:18,342 --> 01:23:19,900
Explain.

1238
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:24,037
I'll ask you one more time. Give me a goddamn name!

1239
01:23:24,038 --> 01:23:25,038
Okey. Okey.

1240
01:23:28,519 --> 01:23:30,919
- All I know is his name. - Give me his name.

1241
01:23:31,021 --> 01:23:34,047
You're looking at a lot of time. You know that?

1242
01:23:34,191 --> 01:23:37,524
Fouchet, I think.

1243
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:39,392
That's his whole name?

1244
01:23:40,831 --> 01:23:42,560
I'm just an errand boy.

1245
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,565
Stop it, please. You're gonna make me cry.

1246
01:23:44,702 --> 01:23:47,569
I swear, watching the house was my first gig.

1247
01:23:47,705 --> 01:23:50,674
How sweet. Does that make you union?

1248
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:54,734
Lf you were a real cop in the field working every day...

1249
01:23:54,879 --> 01:23:56,904
you'd realize that sometimes shit happens.

1250
01:23:57,014 --> 01:24:00,848
Don't give me that crap. You're
on your way to being reassigned.

1251
01:24:00,951 --> 01:24:03,419
- Shut down soon. - Who will reassign me? You?

1252
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:05,421
You don't have the authority to reassign me.

1253
01:24:05,523 --> 01:24:08,287
Until you do, stay the hell out of here!

1254
01:24:08,392 --> 01:24:11,850
They should just bone and get that shit over with.

1255
01:24:11,962 --> 01:24:14,829
I'm getting really tired of this.

1256
01:24:14,932 --> 01:24:17,059
You're tired?

1257
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:18,636
These guard dogs aren't cutting
it. They're overfed. They're lazy.

1258
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:19,500
These guard dogs aren't cutting
it. They're overfed. They're lazy.

1259
01:24:21,238 --> 01:24:24,605
We need video surveillance 'cause
these guard dogs are nothing...

1260
01:24:24,742 --> 01:24:27,973
Jo jo. Don't make this hard!

1261
01:24:31,348 --> 01:24:34,010
Nice running into you.

1262
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:36,881
Always making it hard on your self.

1263
01:24:36,987 --> 01:24:39,785
Gee, Julie, what have you been up to the last couple days?

1264
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:43,326
Nothing. Just hanging out, handcuffed to steering wheels.

1265
01:24:43,394 --> 01:24:46,625
We're looking for someone who
can step on a shit load of heroin.

1266
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:49,631
Do it real fast, real well. We're looking for a real pro.

1267
01:24:49,733 --> 01:24:52,793
I told you already, I'm in the rubber business now.

1268
01:24:52,903 --> 01:24:55,463
Jo jo, we're not playing.

1269
01:24:56,574 --> 01:24:58,667
I'm straight, man.

1270
01:24:58,776 --> 01:25:00,903
I'm straight like a board, like an arrow.

1271
01:25:01,011 --> 01:25:02,808
I'm so straight right now, I'm sick.

1272
01:25:02,913 --> 01:25:06,405
It's a lot of dope. Who could cut it real quick?

1273
01:25:06,517 --> 01:25:10,078
"Cut it"? You cut it up?

1274
01:25:10,187 --> 01:25:13,213
- I don't know nothing about it. - I'm so sick of this bullshit.

1275
01:25:15,926 --> 01:25:19,191
- What's up? - You're pulling a gun on me?

1276
01:25:19,296 --> 01:25:22,754
You guys are cops! I can't believe this!
I should turn you in to Hard Copy.

1277
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,458
- Put your ass on the TV set! - What are you doing?

1278
01:25:24,602 --> 01:25:29,437
I got this! I got 15 bullets in this gun.

1279
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:33,601
Lf you don't start talking to me,
I'll fill your ass full of hot shit.

1280
01:25:33,711 --> 01:25:37,670
- Now, what's up?
- Mike, He's a former ganja smokin' mother fucker. He ain't worth it!

1281
01:25:37,781 --> 01:25:40,409
Do you want some? I'll bust your ass too!

1282
01:25:41,452 --> 01:25:44,387
So sad. You're on your own, Jojo.

1283
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:49,115
- What's up? - I'm telling you like this.

1284
01:25:49,226 --> 01:25:52,684
You splatter his ass, he's no good to us!

1285
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:55,355
Fuck that. I'm not going down over this shit!

1286
01:25:55,466 --> 01:25:59,630
I'm not going down for you killing Jojo the tire man!

1287
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:01,864
I don't want no brain fragments on me!

1288
01:26:01,972 --> 01:26:04,304
That shit gets in your clothes, and it stinks!

1289
01:26:04,408 --> 01:26:07,400
- Fuck that! - I'll tell you what I know.

1290
01:26:07,511 --> 01:26:10,344
I don't know everything. I know a little bit.

1291
01:26:10,447 --> 01:26:12,347
Tell him something!

1292
01:26:12,449 --> 01:26:15,077
It's three guys. They got a laboratory...

1293
01:26:15,185 --> 01:26:17,380
No, it's two guys.

1294
01:26:17,488 --> 01:26:20,651
One guy died in a plane crash last year. It was fucked up.

1295
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:24,387
There should be more! Fuck, man!

1296
01:26:24,495 --> 01:26:26,588
It's one guy, really. It's only one guy.

1297
01:26:26,697 --> 01:26:28,562
- Don't fuck with me. - One main guy.

1298
01:26:28,666 --> 01:26:32,067
This guy's an Einstein, motherfucking genius college boy.

1299
01:26:32,169 --> 01:26:35,036
Egghead motherfucker. He got four eyes and glasses.

1300
01:26:35,139 --> 01:26:37,266
He got a rich mama and daddy
who live out in Coconut Grove.

1301
01:26:37,374 --> 01:26:39,535
Where? Tell him again, Jojo!

1302
01:26:39,643 --> 01:26:42,441
- I don't want you to get hurt! - I'll tell you where he's at.

1303
01:26:42,546 --> 01:26:46,573
- You would do that for us? - Yeah, I want to help you guys.

1304
01:26:46,684 --> 01:26:48,083
You stick that gun down.

1305
01:26:48,185 --> 01:26:52,747
I got the address in the office.

1306
01:26:55,025 --> 01:26:57,050
Thanks a lot. You go grab that.

1307
01:26:57,161 --> 01:26:59,095
- Cool. - You can go ahead.

1308
01:26:59,196 --> 01:27:01,426
- Now? - Now is real good.

1309
01:27:01,532 --> 01:27:03,659
Yeah. This is on me too.

1310
01:27:03,767 --> 01:27:07,760
You guys pick out some whitewalls
as a little gift from me to you.

1311
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:13,575
You made me think you would shoot me for a minute.

1312
01:27:13,677 --> 01:27:15,076
I was.

1313
01:27:17,414 --> 01:27:20,281
When is this punk-ass chemist coming home?

1314
01:27:20,384 --> 01:27:26,084
So this is a stakeout. Not what I imagined.

1315
01:27:26,190 --> 01:27:28,954
Thought there would be more conversation.

1316
01:27:29,059 --> 01:27:33,758
Sorry it's not up to your usual high standards.

1317
01:27:33,864 --> 01:27:36,697
Is he always like this on a stakeout?

1318
01:27:37,735 --> 01:27:41,466
Too much caffeine? Not enough sex?

1319
01:27:41,572 --> 01:27:44,735
I can't believe she went there on you.

1320
01:27:44,842 --> 01:27:50,144
You know who you're talking to?
That's Mike Lowrey over there.

1321
01:27:51,248 --> 01:27:53,113
King Ding-a-ling.

1322
01:27:53,217 --> 01:27:55,651
Why don't you whip it out for her, big boy?

1323
01:27:55,753 --> 01:27:57,948
Uh-huh. Right on your forehead.

1324
01:27:58,055 --> 01:27:59,215
- Shut up. - Yeah.

1325
01:28:08,966 --> 01:28:11,901
- There he is! Let's go! Move! - I'm on him!

1326
01:28:25,949 --> 01:28:28,008
What are our chances?

1327
01:28:28,118 --> 01:28:31,178
Remember Club Hell? Worse.

1328
01:28:33,123 --> 01:28:35,023
That's it. I'm calling major backup.

1329
01:28:35,125 --> 01:28:37,855
- I want swimming ducks in here. - Whoa.

1330
01:28:37,961 --> 01:28:41,192
Hold it. You know Sinclair has
every phone in the station tapped.

1331
01:28:41,298 --> 01:28:44,392
- We have to do that in person. - Shit.

1332
01:28:44,501 --> 01:28:46,526
By the time we deal with her bullshit...

1333
01:28:46,637 --> 01:28:50,198
every junkie in America will be high off our bust.

1334
01:28:52,342 --> 01:28:54,139
Can we help you?

1335
01:28:54,244 --> 01:28:57,213
I staked out all night in that jalopy too.

1336
01:28:57,314 --> 01:28:58,872
I think I earned a peek.

1337
01:28:58,982 --> 01:29:03,385
This is real cop stuff. This is not Charlie's Angels.

1338
01:29:03,487 --> 01:29:05,921
It can't hurt for her to take a peek.

1339
01:29:06,023 --> 01:29:10,050
It can't hurt to look? If they fire
a bullet over here, it will hurt.

1340
01:29:18,368 --> 01:29:21,565
We have guests. Have them followed.

1341
01:29:21,672 --> 01:29:24,163
Don't do anything. Just call me with their location.

1342
01:29:29,847 --> 01:29:31,712
<i>This high-speed chase endingona trestle...</i>

1343
01:29:31,815 --> 01:29:34,545
<i>near the RiverDrive and 34th Street intersection...</i>

1344
01:29:34,651 --> 01:29:38,382
<i>was captured twonights ago b your 6Action News team.</i>

1345
01:29:38,489 --> 01:29:39,956
And while the perpetrator was killed...
Mom!

1346
01:29:40,057 --> 01:29:42,548
<i>Both police officers involved in the incident were uninjured.</i>

1347
01:29:42,659 --> 01:29:45,093
I thought you said Daddy was in Cleveland.

1348
01:29:45,195 --> 01:29:47,129
He can't be in Cleveland.

1349
01:29:47,231 --> 01:29:49,791
<i>The officers didn't like the presence of our camera.</i>

1350
01:29:49,900 --> 01:29:52,130
Your daddy just wishes he was in Cleveland.

1351
01:29:52,236 --> 01:29:56,195
I'm telling you . This Fouchet is a slick one.

1352
01:29:57,541 --> 01:30:00,476
FBI, DEA... They got nothing on him.

1353
01:30:00,577 --> 01:30:02,943
But he has to deal with us today.

1354
01:30:13,991 --> 01:30:15,959
What's that?

1355
01:30:16,059 --> 01:30:19,927
That's the last time they handcuff me. That's what that is.

1356
01:30:20,030 --> 01:30:21,622
Good boy.

1357
01:30:23,367 --> 01:30:25,494
Excuse me, ma'am.

1358
01:30:25,602 --> 01:30:27,695
All visitors must be announced!

1359
01:30:27,804 --> 01:30:31,638
Pisses me off. Lady!

1360
01:30:32,743 --> 01:30:34,802
I guess when you guys get back...

1361
01:30:34,912 --> 01:30:36,641
this will all be over, right?

1362
01:30:36,747 --> 01:30:39,648
You got that right. Don't worry, though.

1363
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:42,685
You'll be set free, cut loose.

1364
01:30:42,786 --> 01:30:45,619
You'll be back to your old life.

1365
01:30:45,722 --> 01:30:48,691
Oops. No more handcuffs.

1366
01:30:53,263 --> 01:30:55,163
- Get up out of here. - That should be Chet...

1367
01:30:55,265 --> 01:30:56,664
with my veggie burger.

1368
01:30:56,767 --> 01:30:58,894
- Move your ass! - You got it.

1369
01:31:02,206 --> 01:31:04,299
Hi. Can I help you?

1370
01:31:04,408 --> 01:31:06,706
Yes, I'm here to kill my husband, Marcus Burnett.

1371
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:10,507
And that would be the tall one or the short one?

1372
01:31:10,614 --> 01:31:14,448
- The short one. - Thought so.

1373
01:31:14,551 --> 01:31:17,179
Is Chet ringing the...

1374
01:31:17,287 --> 01:31:18,948
Baby...

1375
01:31:23,961 --> 01:31:27,761
- Let me get your husband. - Marcus, get over here.

1376
01:31:30,534 --> 01:31:34,129
I'm a... I know what it looks like. Did you get my message?

1377
01:31:36,974 --> 01:31:42,435
Can you leave me and Mrs. Burnett alone for...

1378
01:31:42,579 --> 01:31:44,046
Right.

1379
01:31:45,983 --> 01:31:47,974
Y'all met?

1380
01:31:48,085 --> 01:31:49,848
Baby...

1381
01:31:49,953 --> 01:31:52,387
I know, so let me...

1382
01:31:52,489 --> 01:31:57,017
As far as I'm concerned, you can keep
the wedding ring in your pocket...

1383
01:31:57,127 --> 01:31:58,594
because you , your new little girlfriend...

1384
01:31:58,695 --> 01:32:00,390
Shit.

1385
01:32:00,497 --> 01:32:03,557
And Mike will all be very happy living here.

1386
01:32:03,667 --> 01:32:06,227
- Trust me. - Sweetie... Honey...

1387
01:32:07,804 --> 01:32:09,203
It's not even...

1388
01:32:09,306 --> 01:32:11,570
I saw it on the news.

1389
01:32:11,675 --> 01:32:15,509
- That shit be having a slant. - It's...

1390
01:32:15,612 --> 01:32:17,580
Baby, that's not even...

1391
01:32:17,681 --> 01:32:19,911
- You're no longer welcome in
my house. - He didn't tell you ...

1392
01:32:20,017 --> 01:32:22,417
I was coming in the airport early?

1393
01:32:22,519 --> 01:32:25,716
Remember I said call her? Hold on.

1394
01:32:25,822 --> 01:32:27,949
Tell her what I told you.

1395
01:32:28,058 --> 01:32:30,652
You were gonna bring me to your place...

1396
01:32:32,029 --> 01:32:34,930
All right. I ain't even gonna...

1397
01:32:35,032 --> 01:32:36,795
We're not arguing about this.

1398
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:40,063
I'm raising my... All right, here... Baby...

1399
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:41,797
Believe me, we wanted to tell you.

1400
01:32:41,905 --> 01:32:43,998
It really doesn't matter anymore, Marcus...

1401
01:32:44,107 --> 01:32:47,099
Mike. Kojak. Whatever your name is.

1402
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:49,440
Aside from that fact, I'll tell you something else.

1403
01:32:49,546 --> 01:32:53,778
If his wife could find us, I'm a lot better off on my own.

1404
01:32:53,884 --> 01:32:57,217
This... I could see how it would look a trip.

1405
01:32:58,255 --> 01:33:01,315
You see me run out. I got a shirt open.

1406
01:33:01,425 --> 01:33:03,290
You see Mike half-butt-naked.

1407
01:33:03,393 --> 01:33:05,122
Then you see the white girl.

1408
01:33:05,228 --> 01:33:09,927
So this looks like we having one big
orgy here, and ain't nobody humping.

1409
01:33:10,033 --> 01:33:12,467
Ain't nobody doing none of that.

1410
01:33:12,602 --> 01:33:15,628
It's not what it looks like. Hear what I'm saying.

1411
01:33:15,739 --> 01:33:18,469
Baby, she's a material witness.

1412
01:33:18,575 --> 01:33:20,543
- That... - That's real!

1413
01:33:20,677 --> 01:33:22,577
Baby, listen. That ain't...

1414
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:25,409
It was orders, baby.

1415
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:28,149
Can I talk to you?

1416
01:33:28,251 --> 01:33:30,947
Can you stop so I can talk to you , please?

1417
01:33:31,054 --> 01:33:34,546
Enough with the smooth shit, Mike. It won't work anymore.

1418
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,859
I don't care what you say.

1419
01:33:51,475 --> 01:33:55,377
- Duck! - Julie, get down now!

1420
01:34:26,977 --> 01:34:30,003
- Get out, now! - Mike, help!

1421
01:34:35,619 --> 01:34:37,314
911!

1422
01:34:39,756 --> 01:34:42,589
Yeah, 911? Chet here.

1423
01:34:42,692 --> 01:34:44,922
Go upstairs and take this. Take it!

1424
01:34:47,264 --> 01:34:50,097
Don't worry. I'll keep everybody
calm until my backup arrives.

1425
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:51,895
I love you.

1426
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:54,797
Shit! I forgot to give them the address!

1427
01:35:28,004 --> 01:35:30,939
Come on! Move!

1428
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:33,874
Go! Watch it!

1429
01:35:33,977 --> 01:35:35,467
- Keep going! - Son of a bitch!

1430
01:35:37,914 --> 01:35:38,972
Get her in!

1431
01:35:41,351 --> 01:35:42,841
I'll kill you if you stop running.

1432
01:35:46,823 --> 01:35:47,881
Come on!

1433
01:36:07,744 --> 01:36:09,143
Move!

1434
01:36:22,726 --> 01:36:24,956
It's okay. I'm with the police.

1435
01:36:25,095 --> 01:36:26,892
It's cool. You look great.

1436
01:36:54,090 --> 01:36:55,921
Drive!

1437
01:36:58,828 --> 01:37:01,524
- Stop shooting! - He's still on top!

1438
01:37:03,667 --> 01:37:05,066
I'll get rid of him!

1439
01:37:09,139 --> 01:37:10,936
There he goes!

1440
01:37:31,127 --> 01:37:33,391
Don't ever say I wasn't there for you.

1441
01:37:46,443 --> 01:37:47,842
What is it with you guys?

1442
01:37:47,944 --> 01:37:50,071
How come it's always good news, bad news?

1443
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:53,308
You know exactly where the dope
is, but you lose our only witness.

1444
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:56,783
- I just don't get it. - Pick up your phone.

1445
01:37:59,956 --> 01:38:04,586
I'm keeping your sweet little friend
for four hours until I make my deal.

1446
01:38:04,728 --> 01:38:06,127
And I will make my deal.

1447
01:38:06,229 --> 01:38:09,096
I've just put a bullet in the chemist...

1448
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:11,724
who fucked with my timetable.

1449
01:38:12,936 --> 01:38:15,404
The other one is for the girl. Okay?

1450
01:38:15,538 --> 01:38:17,165
Son of a bitch!

1451
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:22,744
Twisted motherfucker just shot one of his employees.

1452
01:38:22,879 --> 01:38:25,404
Said if we don't back off, he'll kill Julie.

1453
01:38:25,548 --> 01:38:28,415
- Not now. - I told you to play by the rules.

1454
01:38:28,518 --> 01:38:31,112
I am on the verge of solving this case!

1455
01:38:31,221 --> 01:38:33,155
You turned South Beach into a war zone.

1456
01:38:33,289 --> 01:38:36,486
I finally got the authority to shut you
down. You're all reassigned.

1457
01:38:38,695 --> 01:38:40,094
This is lovely.

1458
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:45,562
This guy is painting me into a corner.

1459
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:47,864
He'll kill the girl anyway, and we're won't let her die.

1460
01:38:48,004 --> 01:38:51,371
We're not walking away from this
bust, I don't care what she says.

1461
01:38:51,508 --> 01:38:53,635
The deal goes down in four hours.

1462
01:38:53,777 --> 01:38:56,769
You guys have two hours to find them.

1463
01:38:57,881 --> 01:38:59,940
It's time to get lucky.

1464
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:02,314
Go do what you have to do.

1465
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:08,816
Fletcher, you told us this would
move a little quicker than this.

1466
01:39:08,925 --> 01:39:13,089
It's not that easy, okay? If it was, you'd be doing it.

1467
01:39:13,229 --> 01:39:15,789
Work your magic. You say you're
a computer whiz. Come on.

1468
01:39:15,932 --> 01:39:19,800
Back up off me. I'm doing an illegal favor for you.

1469
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:22,336
This is what I got put in jail for.

1470
01:39:22,439 --> 01:39:23,963
So you back up off me.

1471
01:39:24,107 --> 01:39:27,736
You don't sit your lanky ass down... bottom line...

1472
01:39:27,844 --> 01:39:29,835
I will knock you the fuck out!

1473
01:39:29,946 --> 01:39:32,141
- What the fuck is wrong with you ? - Can you have a seat?

1474
01:39:32,248 --> 01:39:35,615
- You said you'd get me out of jail. - I wasn't lying.

1475
01:39:38,421 --> 01:39:40,218
Cops are so dumb. Look, it's coming up.

1476
01:39:42,459 --> 01:39:44,757
Remember, you promised to get me out.

1477
01:39:44,758 --> 01:39:45,758
Look, Eddie Dominguez.

1478
01:39:48,965 --> 01:39:51,991
There is it. Voila.

1479
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:55,830
"Girlfriend"?

1480
01:40:03,747 --> 01:40:07,444
It was New Year's Eve and my ex-boyfriend, Eddie...

1481
01:40:07,550 --> 01:40:09,484
and this French guy...

1482
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:12,714
took some really horrible pictures of me.

1483
01:40:12,856 --> 01:40:16,792
They said they would put them on the bulletin board...

1484
01:40:16,893 --> 01:40:18,520
of my kid's school...

1485
01:40:18,628 --> 01:40:21,563
unless I gave them a lot of narcotics information.

1486
01:40:21,698 --> 01:40:25,862
But I never gave them you or the girl!

1487
01:40:25,969 --> 01:40:28,665
Look, they got the girl. We need to get them now.

1488
01:40:28,805 --> 01:40:31,535
Because if we don't, they'll kill her.

1489
01:40:31,641 --> 01:40:35,042
- How do you make contact? - I
have their mobile phone number.

1490
01:40:36,146 --> 01:40:37,545
God.

1491
01:40:37,647 --> 01:40:40,912
I'm sorry. Listen, I'll make it up to you.

1492
01:40:41,017 --> 01:40:43,042
I'll do anything you want.

1493
01:40:43,186 --> 01:40:45,154
We don't have a lot of time. Let's go.

1494
01:40:49,025 --> 01:40:51,220
You have sexy ears. You know that?

1495
01:40:51,327 --> 01:40:53,887
I want to lick them.

1496
01:40:55,932 --> 01:40:58,264
- Yeah? - Can I speak to Romeo?

1497
01:40:58,368 --> 01:40:59,926
There ain't no Romeo here, asshole.

1498
01:41:00,036 --> 01:41:02,004
Why are you laughing?

1499
01:41:02,138 --> 01:41:05,665
This cell phone will triangulate him...

1500
01:41:05,775 --> 01:41:07,174
no matter where he goes.

1501
01:41:07,277 --> 01:41:09,302
We'll watch on this map until he stops.

1502
01:41:11,748 --> 01:41:13,773
- Sector234. - The signal is still strong.

1503
01:41:13,883 --> 01:41:15,680
- We still have a lock. - We got them.

1504
01:41:15,785 --> 01:41:20,279
- Come on, baby. - Thank you.

1505
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:23,848
Lucywas the queen, baby. Think about it.

1506
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,928
Lucille Ball was a bimbo. What are you talking about?

1507
01:41:26,029 --> 01:41:28,930
- Desi was the brains. - How could you say that?

1508
01:41:29,065 --> 01:41:32,933
- What do you mean? - Without those bongos, he's nothing.

1509
01:41:33,036 --> 01:41:35,266
It's conga. Don't be so stupid. It's Desi and Lucy...

1510
01:41:35,371 --> 01:41:37,271
Yo, what's up?

1511
01:41:37,373 --> 01:41:39,398
The fucking pencil squad.

1512
01:41:39,509 --> 01:41:41,136
Did you get us assigned to traffic duty?

1513
01:41:41,277 --> 01:41:46,305
- This is real. We got something
for you . - This shit could get you killed.

1514
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,083
Let's go.

1515
01:42:01,898 --> 01:42:03,661
Here we go.

1516
01:42:05,168 --> 01:42:08,535
It's Conrad. I'm calling in a favor.

1517
01:42:11,541 --> 01:42:13,031
Eastbound towards northwest 135th Street.

1518
01:42:14,677 --> 01:42:16,907
Keep going northeast.

1519
01:42:17,013 --> 01:42:19,743
If I'm wrong about this, you can fire my ass.

1520
01:42:19,849 --> 01:42:21,976
This is what I need.

1521
01:42:22,085 --> 01:42:24,315
I need a SWAT team, helicopters...

1522
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:28,186
We're calling all cars, baby. Only
I don't know where I need them.

1523
01:42:29,826 --> 01:42:34,661
- Very nice car you got there. - Yeah. That's my toy.

1524
01:42:34,764 --> 01:42:37,130
I'm taking it with me, for my collection.

1525
01:42:37,233 --> 01:42:40,498
How about the wire transfers?

1526
01:42:41,771 --> 01:42:45,229
Two wire transfers to your banks...

1527
01:42:45,341 --> 01:42:48,504
totaling $180 million.

1528
01:42:49,646 --> 01:42:51,079
And 20 in cash.

1529
01:42:55,218 --> 01:42:57,516
Damn.

1530
01:43:02,325 --> 01:43:04,384
This has been a shitty week.

1531
01:43:05,662 --> 01:43:07,755
Getting full integration on that signal.

1532
01:43:13,102 --> 01:43:15,536
Yeah, we're on the airfield now.

1533
01:43:15,638 --> 01:43:17,868
I bet you it's up in the old hangar section.

1534
01:43:23,579 --> 01:43:25,012
Go ahead. Bring it up.

1535
01:43:27,183 --> 01:43:29,378
Deposit confirmation requested.

1536
01:43:29,485 --> 01:43:31,453
90 million, Geldersbank of zurich.

1537
01:43:36,359 --> 01:43:37,758
No easy approach.

1538
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:39,521
No time. Fuck the backup.

1539
01:43:39,629 --> 01:43:43,588
- We have to go now. - Not a problem.

1540
01:43:46,669 --> 01:43:51,072
- Got an itch? I'd love to scratch it. - Scratch this.

1541
01:43:51,174 --> 01:43:56,077
- I'll scratch whatever you want,
bitch. - Did you go to college?

1542
01:44:06,422 --> 01:44:07,821
Thank you.

1543
01:44:09,726 --> 01:44:12,593
- You sure you want to do this? - Let's go.

1544
01:44:12,695 --> 01:44:14,219
Tuck in your skirt, baby. Come on!

1545
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:16,195
My shit always works sometimes!

1546
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:24,197
This is the best you can buy. It's
been nice doing business with you.

1547
01:44:35,585 --> 01:44:36,779
Shit.

1548
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,945
It's a setup!

1549
01:44:46,329 --> 01:44:49,059
If I get killed, I'm fucking you up!

1550
01:44:51,234 --> 01:44:52,826
Goddamn it, go.

1551
01:45:15,858 --> 01:45:16,984
My God!

1552
01:45:45,955 --> 01:45:47,582
Fuck, man!

1553
01:46:13,483 --> 01:46:15,417
Mother...

1554
01:46:35,538 --> 01:46:37,165
Get down!

1555
01:46:38,941 --> 01:46:40,602
Shit!

1556
01:46:45,014 --> 01:46:46,675
You forgot your boarding pass.

1557
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:12,838
You motherfuckers!

1558
01:47:14,043 --> 01:47:17,809
- What's up? - Shit!

1559
01:48:11,367 --> 01:48:15,394
- Mike, let's go! - Shit! Get in the car!

1560
01:48:18,474 --> 01:48:20,533
Get in! Come on!

1561
01:48:24,380 --> 01:48:25,711
This shit's gonna blow!

1562
01:48:27,116 --> 01:48:28,413
Get up!

1563
01:48:50,172 --> 01:48:53,198
Shit! Please catch that motherfucker!

1564
01:48:53,309 --> 01:48:55,334
- Hes hot me. - Hes hot you ? Hes hot me.

1565
01:48:55,444 --> 01:48:57,378
- You all right? - Just had a little run-in...

1566
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:59,573
with your friend Jim Brown, but I'm fine.

1567
01:49:01,284 --> 01:49:05,550
He steals our shit, kidnaps Julie, shoots at my wife.

1568
01:49:05,655 --> 01:49:07,919
We beating him down!

1569
01:49:11,494 --> 01:49:14,224
Marcus, I just got one question for you , bro.

1570
01:49:14,330 --> 01:49:16,992
How the hell you leave my ass
at a gunfight to go get the car?

1571
01:49:17,099 --> 01:49:20,091
You have got to shut up and let him drive!

1572
01:49:27,943 --> 01:49:30,605
Seems like that gunshot wound
has improved your driving skills.

1573
01:49:34,784 --> 01:49:36,513
You got the right to remain silent.

1574
01:49:38,988 --> 01:49:42,856
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

1575
01:49:42,958 --> 01:49:44,949
- What are you doing? - Getting it out of the way.

1576
01:49:55,971 --> 01:49:57,336
Just punch it, man! Go!

1577
01:50:03,512 --> 01:50:06,140
This car's faster! This is a faster car!

1578
01:50:06,248 --> 01:50:09,843
It's one or the other, baby! It's him or it's us!

1579
01:50:13,656 --> 01:50:15,146
You better fucking win, that's all I know!

1580
01:50:15,257 --> 01:50:17,191
You better win!

1581
01:50:38,247 --> 01:50:40,477
Now that's how you supposed to drive!

1582
01:50:40,583 --> 01:50:43,814
From now on, that's how you drive!

1583
01:51:09,111 --> 01:51:11,341
Freeze!

1584
01:51:16,285 --> 01:51:17,912
He ain't even worth killing.

1585
01:51:17,913 --> 01:51:18,913
Freeze! Freeze!

1586
01:51:51,987 --> 01:51:54,717
I bet when your punk ass woke up this morning...

1587
01:51:54,824 --> 01:51:58,624
you didn't think about 5:00 you'd have a hole in your leg.

1588
01:52:02,164 --> 01:52:05,065
You couldn't kill me, you chicken shit, could you?

1589
01:52:05,167 --> 01:52:07,829
I could. You're talking like it's over.

1590
01:52:07,937 --> 01:52:09,871
I was just pausing.

1591
01:52:10,005 --> 01:52:13,031
I'm starting to get the hang of this marksman shit.

1592
01:52:13,175 --> 01:52:17,202
Shooting them from 30 yards while
they're running away is not it.

1593
01:52:17,346 --> 01:52:21,009
Here's where it is, right here.
Point-blank, up close and personal.

1594
01:52:22,485 --> 01:52:24,749
That's what I'm talking about.

1595
01:52:24,854 --> 01:52:26,481
Would you do it?

1596
01:52:26,622 --> 01:52:28,522
Mike, step off.

1597
01:52:28,624 --> 01:52:30,717
Do it.

1598
01:52:40,703 --> 01:52:42,796
It's over.

1599
01:52:48,878 --> 01:52:52,279
He's a joke. He's a motherfuckin'joke.

1600
01:53:17,106 --> 01:53:20,769
I ever tell you I love you , man?

1601
01:53:20,876 --> 01:53:24,937
Yeah, you always be getting emotional after gunfights.

1602
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:27,139
It's 'cause I'm glad we survived.

1603
01:53:27,249 --> 01:53:29,274
Shit.

1604
01:53:29,385 --> 01:53:32,149
What are you talking about?

1605
01:53:32,288 --> 01:53:34,848
I love you too, man.

1606
01:53:34,957 --> 01:53:36,948
Don't be looking at me. I said, "I love you ."

1607
01:53:37,092 --> 01:53:39,754
- I said that shit. - You my boy, man!

1608
01:53:39,895 --> 01:53:42,159
No, you like my brother, man.

1609
01:53:42,264 --> 01:53:44,459
So what am I?

1610
01:53:45,868 --> 01:53:48,803
- Man... - Julie, sweetie, you ...

1611
01:53:48,904 --> 01:53:50,838
You're a little dangerous.

1612
01:53:50,906 --> 01:53:55,275
Yeah, you're like a magnet for random gunfire.

1613
01:53:55,377 --> 01:53:57,777
But you're all right. You're cool.

1614
01:53:57,846 --> 01:53:59,643
You down.

1615
01:54:01,283 --> 01:54:03,513
So what's next?

1616
01:54:06,956 --> 01:54:10,858
See, there ain't gonna be no next.

1617
01:54:10,926 --> 01:54:12,860
Whoa, Marcus. Come on.

1618
01:54:12,962 --> 01:54:16,693
You wanted Mike Lowrey. You got him.

1619
01:54:16,799 --> 01:54:19,996
Right here. That's Mike. Old Mike Lowrey.

1620
01:54:20,135 --> 01:54:23,901
I'm going home to my wife to get my quality time.

1621
01:54:24,039 --> 01:54:25,870
Marcus, stop playing, man.

1622
01:54:25,975 --> 01:54:28,500
I been beat three times since we been out here.

1623
01:54:28,644 --> 01:54:33,013
I'm cool man. I don't need help. Please, back up.

1624
01:54:33,148 --> 01:54:35,048
Why are you going home to your wife?

1625
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:37,345
You got shot in the leg. Your dick probably don't work.

1626
01:54:37,453 --> 01:54:39,853
Marcus, do you have the keys?

1627
01:54:39,955 --> 01:54:42,617
Mike wanted me to go to this gunfight.

1628
01:54:42,758 --> 01:54:45,352
Then there was this witness.

1629
01:54:47,296 --> 01:54:49,526
My man! Sorry.

1630
01:54:49,665 --> 01:54:52,190
- Can you let me out of here? - I don't have the keys.

1631
01:54:52,334 --> 01:54:54,859
What do you mean? Why wouldn't you have keys?

1632
01:54:55,004 --> 01:54:56,869
Would you ... Ouch.

1633
01:54:56,972 --> 01:55:00,738
Marcus, I thought you said you loved me. Show me love!

1634
01:55:00,739 --> 01:55:07,739
