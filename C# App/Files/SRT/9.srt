00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:47,260
The first time I was in love 
 was June, 1975, in Boca Raton.

Her name was Coty Pierce.

She lived there with her parents 
 and her little sister Karrie...

They just didn't know it.

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,280
No one did.

11
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,380
I lived with them all that June.

I loved the expression 
 on their faces when they slept.

15
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,640
And then I decided 
 to declare myself...

16
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,810
and show them 
 how much they loved me.

And the turtleneck 
 you're wearing...

84
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,180
is that to hide bruises?

no one will ever know 
 the truth.

She called me. 
 I called them back.

Remember that?

132

ALEX: Compulsively. And if 
 he follows true to form...

791
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:35,660
he's due to hit California 
 pretty quick.

792
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:37,830
Can the FBI pick him up?

793
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,040
If I give Rudolph to the FBI 
 and they make one mistake...

what happens to all these girls?

No FBI.

No. That's not

 by about a hundred, Kate.

It's in the Japanese character 
 to do this sort of thing.

1110

They build 
 these special ships...

 navigable extremes...

 iceberg they can find...

1113
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,440

I have fucked nearly 
 100 of them in 75 ways...

 any of them.

 Die Welt der Flagellanten.

Do you know it?

1137
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,430
It took me 3 hours 
 to tie her up properly.

1138

And consensually, by the way.

 we'd discuss that at the trial.

Maybe you'd like me to go 
 on record now about Naomi.

1145

I'll start with 
 the first time I saw her.

In my office.

1147
01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:07,260
She was wearing a silk blouse, 
 which pleases me...

1148
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:10,430
because I like to turn up 
 the air conditioning...

You know, tweak the nipples.

1151
01:24:16,110 --> 01:24:18,600
You should have seen 
 how self-conscious she was...

1152
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:23,150
how nervous 
 the chill in the air made her.

1153
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,400
And, like the others, her manner 
 belied her real predilections.

1154

Which reminds me, Dr. Cross...

RUSKIN: 
 How are you feeling, by the way?

1429
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:05,020
You feeling like you're 
 getting back on your feet?

1430
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:06,520
KATE: I guess 
 if I felt solid anywhere...

1431
01:43:06,540 --> 01:43:08,280
it should be in this house.

1432
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:10,570
I've been in it in one way 
 or another my whole life.

1433
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:11,990
It was my great-aunt's.

1434
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:16,200
But I don't know.

1435
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:19,660
It's just different now. 
 Something's off.

1436
01:43:24,890 --> 01:43:27,250
KATE: I used to walk 
 in the middle of the night...

1437
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:29,340
down to the corner market 
 for a quart of milk.

RUSKIN: That's true.

1439
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:34,680
I mean, people just get 
 complacent. It happens.

Would you please hand me 
 the big chopping knife?

KATE: I've been thinking about 
 spending more time at the dojo.

1444
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:49,020
RUSKIN: Kick boxing's fine, 
 but that's not what I mean.

1445
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:52,650
I'm talking prevention.

We teach things like, uh... 
 varying your routine.

Keeping your lights on at night. 
 Maybe getting a dog.

1448
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:03,960
I'm sorry. 
 Does this bother you?

1449
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:06,380
KATE: 
 It's good. I need to hear it.

1450
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:09,170
Just simple things, like, um...

Anyone with a scanner 
 can listen in.

RUSKIN: Night before, 
 anyone can tear through it.

1458
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:28,230
KATE: Who in the world possibly 
 cares how much tuna I eat?

1459
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:29,940
Would you rinse this 
 off for me, please?

 those 30-gallon plastic sacks.

Haul it down 
 to an abandoned lot and bingo!

What kind of lipstick 
 she wears...

and used condoms.

How often's she gettin' it? 
 Twice a week?

Three times?

[Losing accent] Of course, 
 that doesn't apply to you.

Let's face it. In your case, 
 it's been quite a while.

Not since that...

but now I'm going 
 to show you sacrifice.

 Are you going to cut me?

Sometimes 
 I take a strange notion
