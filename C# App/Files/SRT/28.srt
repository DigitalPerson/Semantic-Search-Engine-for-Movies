1
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:27,483
Miz Kelty?

2
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:51,164
Miz Kelty?

3
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:30,014
You don't need me, Mr. Baring.
Just wasting my time again

4
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:34,465
You know where I am.
No square dancing!

5
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:39,007
Do you reckon he
ought to be in the hospital?

6
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:42,174
No, ma'am. My advice is

7
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:44,800
don't go near those places
unless they pay you a heap of money

8
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:49,819
Your father's eighty-seven years old, Janet.
Just be there for him

9
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:52,128
Don't worry,
I ain't a-gonna go nowhere

10
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:55,206
Been looking for you all over, Jerry

11
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:58,311
- Take care
- See ya

12
00:04:58,535 --> 00:05:00,575
- Thanks for seeing Papa
- Sure

13
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:09,628
Billy Fisher found her.
He delivers the groceries out there

14
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:12,991
I guess she's what you'd call a hermit

15
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:20,034
She talked kinda funny, too.
She kinda like, uh, "Durr yurr mmm..."

16
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:21,960
Only one side of her face was working

17
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:24,196
You try talking out
of one side of your face

18
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:25,671
Oh, so you seen her then?

19
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,386
Just the once.
When I first moved out here

20
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:30,050
It seemed to me she was doing okay

21
00:05:30,217 --> 00:05:32,770
Oh, sure now, she lived her own life

22
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:46,274
I didn't know there were
folks living this far out

23
00:05:46,985 --> 00:05:49,571
Well, there aren't.
Just ol' Miz Kelty

24
00:05:56,682 --> 00:05:57,664
God

25
00:05:58,186 --> 00:05:59,430
It's beautiful

26
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:03,584
Well, look at that

27
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:06,536
Just laid herself down...
folded up her arms and died

28
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:08,932
Don't look like she's been gone long

29
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:09,985
No...

30
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:13,824
In this heat, you'd know
if she'd been dead more than a day

31
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,525
Well... anything
I should be concerned about?

32
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:20,705
Not that I can see

33
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,370
I guess she hasn't been
outside in a long time

34
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:27,432
Well, that figures. The last time I seen
her in town was more'n a year back

35
00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:34,276
Is this for real?

36
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,195
No electricity, no phone...
no running water

37
00:06:51,276 --> 00:06:53,000
She lived here all alone, huh?

38
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:55,235
Well, that's what hermits do, lovell

39
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:57,641
They live alone and they die alone

40
00:07:01,324 --> 00:07:02,983
Peterson to Robbinsville base

41
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:11,370
Okay-ay-ay, we're outta here!

42
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,476
Let's get back to civilization

43
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:20,419
Billy Fisher found her when
he delivered the groceries?

44
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:21,700
Yeah, that's right

45
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:23,494
I'll catch up with you

46
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:28,518
Hi there

47
00:08:36,593 --> 00:08:38,349
It's okay, I won't hurt you

48
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,430
- Stay back!
- Well, what the hell is it?

49
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:52,142
- Stay back!
- What the hell is it, Jerry?

50
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:53,834
- Put the gun away. Leave her alone
- Don't touch my gun, Jerry

51
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:55,400
- Come on, let's go. Come on
- What the hell is it?

52
00:08:55,473 --> 00:08:59,368
- Get out. She's scared
- She's scared? Holy shit! What...?

53
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:01,935
Good God Almighty

54
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:10,124
You ever heard of
anyone else living out here?

55
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,978
No, never

56
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,241
- Are you all right? Did you get hurt?
- Fine. Fine

57
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:18,537
- Okay
- Jesus

58
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,741
Let's take this one step at a time.
Stay here. I'm gonna go back inside

59
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:24,849
Jerry, I can't let you go back in there.
We don't even know what that thing is

60
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:27,249
It's a human being.
And she's frightened

61
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:29,387
Well, what are you gonna do?

62
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,746
Talk to her. If I can

63
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,266
Please... don't be afraid

64
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:22,931
The Lord led you here, stranger.
Guard my Nell. Nell

65
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:26,059
Good child. the Lord care you

66
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,436
Man, did you see this? That crazy old
woman owned half of this damn woods

67
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,323
What kind a deal is this?

68
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:35,602
The first stranger who finds
her is supposed to look after her?

69
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:38,639
- Well, that means you, Jer
- Oh, sure. Just what I need

70
00:10:39,061 --> 00:10:41,069
Well, "the Lord led you here".
There you go

71
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:42,186
You led me here

72
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:45,678
Well, you want the Lord
to take care of you or not?

73
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:50,227
The last time I saw the Lord
was in church on my wedding day.

74
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:52,050
And look how that turned out. Come on

75
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,043
Well, she's definitely over age

76
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,699
So I guess we notify
the Adult Protective Service

77
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:03,563
She doesn't need a social worker.
She needs a padded call

78
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,019
That is one seriously disturbed lady

79
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:10,261
Well, I'm afraid that's
gonna be your territory, Jerry

80
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:11,694
Thanks

81
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:14,287
Well, "the Lord led you here, stranger"

82
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:27,277
It's okay. It's okay. It's all right,
just calm yourself down. It's okay

83
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,750
Calm down, calm down

84
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:31,729
It's all right calm down.

85
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,774
No! Whackie!

86
00:11:38,807 --> 00:11:40,782
No. Calm down

87
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:41,772
Come in

88
00:11:41,816 --> 00:11:43,703
Nicole, you want to sing
"Open/Shut" then?

89
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,591
Doctor Olsen?

90
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,014
Could you close the door, please?
Thanks

91
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:51,347
They said it was fine to drop by

92
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:54,166
I'm Jerry Lovell. I've got a family
practice over in Robbinsville

93
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,311
Hi

94
00:11:55,512 --> 00:11:56,919
This is my assistant, Diane

95
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,247
So what can I do for you?

96
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:03,160
Well... I could use some advice

97
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,773
This, uh, this woman speaks
an unknown language?

98
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:23,920
Her mother was paralysed down one side.
Apparently a series of strokes

99
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:27,193
It's possible the girl picked up
the speech distortions

100
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:30,320
Speech distortion's not
an unknown language

101
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:32,689
I know. It's more than that

102
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:37,972
Well, I want to see her right away

103
00:12:38,777 --> 00:12:40,785
How about first thing
in the morning? Nine?

104
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,835
Thanks. If you're not too busy

105
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:48,344
Well, no known living next of kin

106
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:51,994
Violet Kelty was just about
as lone as a soul can get in this world

107
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:54,396
- Hmm. Except she wasn't
- Sheriff's Department

108
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:57,080
Well, now officially that
"creature" does not exist

109
00:13:57,373 --> 00:13:58,300
Todd?

110
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:01,944
There, see what you make of that

111
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:05,049
Right here?

112
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:06,810
Perterson

113
00:14:07,357 --> 00:14:11,896
Yeah, hey, Sally, what...

114
00:14:15,741 --> 00:14:16,919
Where is she now?

115
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,213
I'll be right over.

116
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,998
Yeah, thanks, Sally,
I appreciate your trouble

117
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,882
You think that's how
she got pregnant? Rape?

118
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:27,034
I have to go

119
00:14:27,646 --> 00:14:29,075
- Mary, huh?
- Yeah

120
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,166
My Mary

121
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:47,804
You'll be all right now, honey.
He's on his way. He's a-coming

122
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,095
Thanks, Sally

123
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:56,725
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay. I'm here now

124
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:58,940
Why'd you get upset?

125
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,047
Hey!

126
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,771
Come on... come on.
There you go

127
00:15:12,768 --> 00:15:14,524
Okay, folks, the show's over

128
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:18,876
- You guys okay?
- Yeah, yeah. We've been here before

129
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,181
Hi

130
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:27,670
You found me

131
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:29,536
Early

132
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:30,975
Yeah, I'm always early

133
00:15:31,265 --> 00:15:32,213
Not a bad day

134
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:34,171
What happened to her?

135
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,737
Nothing and everything

136
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:37,758
It hits her once in a while

137
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:42,076
- Is there any obvious cause?
- You want a list? Life's touch

138
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,000
But she's luckier than some.
She's got a good husband there

139
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:50,200
Ready to head for the woods?

140
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:32,635
The things people
do to their kids. Jesus

141
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:34,562
She's not like that
when she's on her own

142
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:36,476
Strangers scare her

143
00:16:37,156 --> 00:16:37,984
How do you know?

144
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,900
I've been watching her

145
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:49,279
She's been, uh, completely isolated.
Almost certainly mentally retarded

146
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:52,664
A blood test will pick up childhood
disease, any kind of metabolic disorder

147
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,322
Oh, you carry a blood kit?

148
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:59,966
You think she's gonna sit there
and let me stick a needle in her?

149
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,267
I'll hold her

150
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:09,056
It's okay, darling. It's okay

151
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,929
Do it

152
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,084
Do it

153
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:34,783
Shh... shh. It's okay

154
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:39,456
If you're right...a big if...

155
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:42,053
if she's never left this cabin
or this part of the forest

156
00:17:42,726 --> 00:17:44,548
never known anybody but her mother...

157
00:17:44,934 --> 00:17:47,138
never encountered any of
the images of the modern world,

158
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,401
never seen a car,
a television a gun, a Hershey bar...

159
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:54,336
never heard rock'n'roll music or
But now you said she can talk

160
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:56,702
Yeah, but it's some kinda
language of her own

161
00:17:57,126 --> 00:18:00,422
Well, we haven't had a true wild child
in this country for sixty years

162
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:02,150
She's not a wild child

163
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:04,352
It's just a shorthand term, Dr. Lovell

164
00:18:04,486 --> 00:18:05,414
She's not a child

165
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:08,288
No. That's what makes
this case so unique

166
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,781
This is not your field, I know

167
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:12,677
Bur let me tell you
what we're dealing with here

168
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,149
Some pretty fundamental issues

169
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,120
How was the personality formed?
We don't know

170
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:20,001
How much is innate,
how much is learned? We don't know

171
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:22,722
Where do gender roles come from?
We don't know

172
00:18:22,856 --> 00:18:25,474
Because you can't take a baby
and have it grow up in a lab...

173
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:28,479
- and monitor and control every influence...
- You want to have her grow up in a lab?

174
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,813
Grow up in a lab? No

175
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:35,807
Dr. Lovell thinks you're gonna do
a Frankenstein number on her, Al

176
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,921
Oh, well, uh... all right...

177
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:40,803
Let me ask you this, Dr. Lovell

178
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:43,431
Can she survive on her own?

179
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:45,924
Well

180
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,070
I don't know

181
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,762
Yeah, well, all right,
suppose she cannot

182
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:51,809
Who's gonna look after her? You?

183
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:54,591
Me? Why me?

184
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:56,320
All right, so who's volunteering?

185
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,017
I can tell you this much

186
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:01,218
It's gonna be somebody
with an ulterior motive

187
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:04,321
Everybody who cares for
someone has an ulterior motive

188
00:19:04,906 --> 00:19:06,018
Even Mother Teresa

189
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:09,161
She wants to know that her life
has been of some use to others

190
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:10,663
And so do I

191
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:12,960
Excuse me

192
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:47,235
Oh, shit

193
00:20:49,646 --> 00:20:51,173
Yeah, I'm on my way

194
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:53,478
Well, Lovell, did I wake you up?

195
00:20:54,157 --> 00:20:57,834
Hey, Todd, it's okay.
I overslept. What's up?

196
00:20:58,318 --> 00:21:02,027
I'm looking at a commitment order
that's just been issued for Nell

197
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,732
What does that mean?

198
00:21:05,934 --> 00:21:07,756
Well, it means they're
gonna take her away

199
00:21:09,263 --> 00:21:11,597
It's a court order, Jerry.
I have to enforce it

200
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:12,875
When, now?

201
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:14,435
Well, that's what it says

202
00:21:16,335 --> 00:21:17,415
Can you give me some time?

203
00:21:18,607 --> 00:21:22,055
- I guess I could hold off till after lunch
- Try and make it a long lunch, will ya?

204
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:45,257
Well, what do you say there, Don?

205
00:21:46,128 --> 00:21:47,273
Not fishing today?

206
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:48,430
Todd

207
00:21:49,872 --> 00:21:51,181
Sorry about this, Jerry?

208
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,142
Hi

209
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:58,762
Well, we've...
come to pick Nell up

210
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,142
Yeah, I heard

211
00:22:01,457 --> 00:22:02,798
I've got the court order

212
00:22:07,921 --> 00:22:10,223
You do know it's in her
own best interests right?

213
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:11,536
Did you ask her?

214
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:14,854
Well, you know that's impossible

215
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:17,168
Tell 'em, Don

216
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,879
Well, I have a court order
here that says...

217
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:23,949
if you don't get Nell's informed consent,
you're violatin' her rights

218
00:22:23,985 --> 00:22:27,149
And if you do that, I'm gonna sue
you all the way to the Supreme Court

219
00:22:32,497 --> 00:22:34,669
How can she give
her informed consent?

220
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:38,956
She doesn't even speak English!

221
00:22:39,122 --> 00:22:42,417
If she doesn't speak English, she has to
give her consent through an interpreter

222
00:22:43,474 --> 00:22:45,165
What interpreter? This is crazy!

223
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:48,362
There isn't anybody
who speaks her language!

224
00:22:49,842 --> 00:22:51,850
Then I guess somebody's
gonna have to learn

225
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:12,754
Dr. Lovell's view seems to be that
this woman's natural habitat is...

226
00:23:12,787 --> 00:23:16,682
a primitive cabin in the heart of
the forest. Well, I take a different view

227
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:21,416
I see... a victim of abuse... and neglect...

228
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:24,755
I see a mature woman who's
been robbed of half her life

229
00:23:25,876 --> 00:23:29,738
Her mother never gave her a choice.
Isn't Dr. Lovell doing the same thing?

230
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:32,623
Hiding her away as his own
private pet in the woods?

231
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,213
We all know what happens to
these freak cases, Your Honor

232
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,776
They get a year of celebrity

233
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:40,499
A starring role in
a few academic papers

234
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:44,172
Then they get to spend the rest of
their lives in a state institution...

235
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,883
abandoned... by the very doctors and
scientists who claimed to be helping them

236
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:54,314
Nell has a home. She has a life.
She's not asking for any help

237
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:59,536
So just be sure she needs care...
before she gets cared to death

238
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:01,812
If she's ever gonna leave that cabin

239
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:03,252
she's gonna need skills
she doesn't presently possess

240
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:05,008
How do you know
she wants to leave the cabin?

241
00:24:05,046 --> 00:24:07,053
You think that's the best
life we can give her?

242
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:08,751
I don't think her life is ours to give

243
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:11,539
People can help each other, Dr. Lovell. We
don't have to do everything on our own

244
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:13,199
Okay, I think I'm getting the picture

245
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:15,570
Here's what I'm gonna do

246
00:24:16,118 --> 00:24:18,507
I'm gonna defer my decision
for three months

247
00:24:19,062 --> 00:24:22,226
This time to be used for the proposed
of observation and assessment

248
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:26,225
And I hope that by the end of this period,
this court is better informed

249
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,173
Hey

250
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,149
You sure you can make it,
roughing it like this?

251
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,057
I don't see an air conditioning unit

252
00:25:03,992 --> 00:25:05,780
You okay about breathing raw air?

253
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:15,285
Wow, who's paying for
this floating palace?

254
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:18,320
My department.
This project has very high priority

255
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,856
Oh, I bet it does

256
00:25:22,649 --> 00:25:23,761
So how long are you staying?

257
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:25,752
Three months

258
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:29,681
Don't you have a life?

259
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:32,344
It can wait

260
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:35,638
How long're you staying?

261
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:37,977
I don't know

262
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,625
Well, won't your, uh, patient miss you?

263
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:43,218
I've got someone to cover for me.
Everybody's replaceable

264
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:48,311
so I guess you'll make full professor
on the back of this case, huh?

265
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:49,649
Sure, why not?

266
00:25:57,018 --> 00:26:02,321
Look, I'm here to do ajob. Anything
that helps me do thatjob is fine by me

267
00:26:02,554 --> 00:26:04,310
If you want to be a Boy Scout, go ahead...

268
00:26:04,474 --> 00:26:07,409
but I'd appreciate it if you could
do your best not to screw it up

269
00:29:11,873 --> 00:29:12,822
What's all this?

270
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,790
What's it look like?

271
00:29:17,954 --> 00:29:20,026
You never said anything
about video cameras to me

272
00:29:20,546 --> 00:29:22,718
Well, it's the least
intrusive method of observation

273
00:29:22,754 --> 00:29:24,063
Well, how'd you rig this up?

274
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:27,133
Well, she was asleep.
She sleeps most of the day

275
00:29:32,258 --> 00:29:33,371
Mind if I dress?

276
00:30:05,635 --> 00:30:06,617
Hi

277
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,748
I'm Jerry

278
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:26,339
You're Nell. I'm Jerry

279
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,730
Me

280
00:32:06,184 --> 00:32:08,126
Me. That's right. Jerry

281
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:12,673
You're Nell

282
00:32:16,648 --> 00:32:18,787
That's right. That's right

283
00:32:55,787 --> 00:32:57,063
That's right

284
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:05,513
She has an objective self
and a subjective self that I

285
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:07,718
I've never seen such a
perfect projection before

286
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:10,568
That's, that's "me"...
me... in the mirror

287
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:11,912
You'd think it would be
the other way around

288
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:15,688
But that's "me" out there.
almost like she's displacing herself

289
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:17,250
Have you run any tests?

290
00:33:18,187 --> 00:33:20,740
Only blood works,
and no abnormalities there

291
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:23,430
We'll have to run competency
tests before the court hearing, but...

292
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,765
I'd say it's still too soon

293
00:33:27,243 --> 00:33:28,869
I want you to hear
this language she speaks

294
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:30,533
What is this gesture about?

295
00:33:31,372 --> 00:33:34,504
I don't know.
It's some kind of self comforting

296
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:36,394
She did it when
she was saying "me"

297
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,783
You should explain the speech
degradation is misleading

298
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:43,651
That's right.
the mother was aphasic

299
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,098
but the idiosyncratic word
forms...you tell me

300
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:02,213
Incredible

301
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,154
You mind if I talk?

302
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:43,430
I like it here

303
00:34:45,806 --> 00:34:46,952
It's a quiet place

304
00:34:48,943 --> 00:34:50,601
You've got the right idea, Nell

305
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,123
You live with people,
you get problems

306
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:56,524
First they screw you up...

307
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,213
then they leave you, right?

308
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:06,222
You ever get lonely, Nell?

309
00:35:12,272 --> 00:35:14,127
I never had any brothers
and sisters either

310
00:35:15,376 --> 00:35:18,475
"Very unusual for
an Irish family, Dr. Lovell"

311
00:35:18,512 --> 00:35:20,105
Oh, sure, you better believe it.

312
00:35:20,561 --> 00:35:22,765
God, there was a family
lived next door.

313
00:35:23,024 --> 00:35:27,662
The Connors. The Connors...
They had seven kids. Seven

314
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,927
Always yelling and screaming,
having a good time

315
00:35:31,953 --> 00:35:32,880
Me watching...

316
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,884
over a fence, through a window

317
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,529
I heard music. A band

318
00:35:40,401 --> 00:35:42,223
This parade was
coming down the street

319
00:35:42,898 --> 00:35:44,075
I'm on our front steps

320
00:35:44,337 --> 00:35:46,792
Jamie Connor grabs me
pulling me into the street

321
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:50,570
"No, no, no, no, no" My heart's
going ba-boom, ba- boom, ba-boom

322
00:35:50,801 --> 00:35:54,118
The band's going bum-bum-bum,
bam, bam-bam-bam, bam.

323
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:58,319
Oh, but I was so excited.
Jamie's got me by my hand

324
00:35:58,482 --> 00:36:02,540
We're doing this. Some kid's got my
other hand, the band right behind us

325
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:11,374
You get close to a band.
you know about it

326
00:36:12,147 --> 00:36:15,376
I'm marching, I'm with the other kids.
I wasn't alone

327
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:17,386
You know what I'm saying?

328
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:18,985
We weren't talking

329
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:24,809
Just... just...enjoying
this wonderful spirit

330
00:37:47,414 --> 00:37:48,461
Did you see that?

331
00:37:48,694 --> 00:37:49,622
- Yeah, I saw it
- Did you see it?

332
00:37:49,654 --> 00:37:51,029
- Yeah, I saw it
- She talked! To me!

333
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:52,468
- I know
- Hold out your hand

334
00:37:53,718 --> 00:37:55,540
- I didn't ask for that. She did
- I know

335
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:01,233
- You know what it means?
- No!

336
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:05,265
Okay, so here's what I've been thinking.
Nell speaks English

337
00:38:05,943 --> 00:38:07,504
English? Oh, come on

338
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,525
Yeah, most of the time anyway. Look

339
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:10,899
Come here. Take a look at this.

340
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:15,796
"Af'ah I done go, ga'inja come" There's
only one word of pure Nellish there

341
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:17,236
Sounds like language
analysis to me

342
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:18,733
- Dr. Olsen
- All right, o- okay

343
00:38:19,032 --> 00:38:22,447
"Spee"...speak. "Af'ah"... after.
She's droppin' consonants

344
00:38:22,487 --> 00:38:25,008
Yeah, but...what does "chickabee" mean?

345
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:27,568
She says, "Missa chickabee."
What's "missa"?

346
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,160
I don't know

347
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:33,751
When she's scared she says. "Tata, tata"
Wh-what's that?

348
00:38:34,328 --> 00:38:35,343
I don't know yet

349
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,189
Where is she?

350
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:33,941
Look at that

351
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:42,867
- We shouldn't be watching this
- Why not?

352
00:39:43,226 --> 00:39:44,274
She's naked

353
00:39:45,147 --> 00:39:46,129
So?

354
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:48,497
I think she's beautiful

355
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:55,574
You think I'm planning to abuse
the doctor patient relationship?

356
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:58,840
- Are you?
- No

357
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:03,671
Just because I think she's beautiful
doesn't mean I want to have sex with her

358
00:40:04,028 --> 00:40:05,883
I mean, I think you're beautiful, but...

359
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,123
Oh, thanks

360
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:09,307
You know what I mean

361
00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:11,095
That's okay

362
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:15,570
- No, look, I didn't mean it that...
- It's okay. I'm a big girl

363
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,289
What is it with you and Nell?

364
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:34,674
It's like...

365
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:38,134
there's no one else in the world

366
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:45,781
Like she doesn't...need anybody

367
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:54,260
Can you live your
whole life that way or...

368
00:40:55,741 --> 00:40:57,465
does it drive you crazy in the end?

369
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:01,150
I don't understand, Nell.
What, what's "missa"?

370
00:42:13,057 --> 00:42:15,577
Oh, I've got it! "Missa"...little

371
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:19,416
Little. "Erna"...big. Huh?

372
00:42:20,065 --> 00:42:21,658
So, so what's "t'ee"?

373
00:42:32,257 --> 00:42:35,040
"T'ee"...tree. "Tree in the wind!"
You're a tree in the wind!

374
00:42:37,378 --> 00:42:39,833
Hey, Nell, Nell.
Show me "t'ee"

375
00:42:40,065 --> 00:42:41,789
Come on, show me "t'ee."
Show me the trees

376
00:42:42,114 --> 00:42:43,608
Come on, Nell, it'll be fun

377
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,431
Come on, we'll have fun

378
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,033
- Tata!
- Tata?

379
00:42:48,162 --> 00:42:48,991
Tata!

380
00:42:49,763 --> 00:42:52,480
Tata. What...? Tata? You're afraid?

381
00:42:53,826 --> 00:42:55,168
What are you afraid of, Nell?

382
00:43:05,923 --> 00:43:07,036
What's "eva'dur"?

383
00:43:37,316 --> 00:43:38,363
You okay?

384
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:46,683
"Missa"...little

385
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,350
"Erna"...big

386
00:43:49,285 --> 00:43:52,220
"Tata"...potato. Just kidding

387
00:43:52,324 --> 00:43:55,390
Frightened..."tata"...
frightened. "T'ee"..."tree"

388
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:57,757
Hey

389
00:44:03,397 --> 00:44:04,924
Well, how long has she been there?

390
00:44:54,855 --> 00:44:55,968
Turn if off

391
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,182
Turn that thing off!

392
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,030
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

393
00:45:08,136 --> 00:45:09,958
She's never heard
music before in her life

394
00:45:09,991 --> 00:45:11,715
- Hey sometimes people just do things!
- Did you think of that?

395
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:12,959
It's called impulse

396
00:45:13,063 --> 00:45:15,398
- It's called doing what you want...
- You ought to try it some time!

397
00:45:15,496 --> 00:45:17,700
whenever you want to and
not giving a shit about anyone else!

398
00:45:17,768 --> 00:45:19,972
And I grew out of it
around about the age of six!

399
00:46:05,322 --> 00:46:07,045
What the fuck is that?

400
00:46:11,498 --> 00:46:12,327
What's wrong?

401
00:46:14,922 --> 00:46:16,351
What...what's gone away?

402
00:46:21,834 --> 00:46:24,485
Ah... word of the Lord.
I'll get it. I'll get it!

403
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:26,114
It's safe

404
00:46:33,259 --> 00:46:35,114
I'm sorry.
We shouldn't have taken it away

405
00:46:53,676 --> 00:46:55,399
You want... you want
me to read it to you, huh?

406
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:12,069
a people...laden with iniquity,
a seed of evildoers

407
00:47:12,685 --> 00:47:14,310
children that are corrupters...

408
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:16,674
they have forsaken the Lord

409
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:20,618
They have provoked the...

410
00:47:22,221 --> 00:47:23,169
Eva'dur...

411
00:47:25,357 --> 00:47:26,535
A seed of evildoers

412
00:47:27,405 --> 00:47:28,388
Nell

413
00:47:28,685 --> 00:47:29,579
Nell

414
00:47:30,253 --> 00:47:31,431
Show me "eva'dur."

415
00:47:36,525 --> 00:47:37,419
Nell

416
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:40,739
Nell?

417
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,180
Nell. Nell

418
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,695
Show me "eva'dur." Show me

419
00:47:47,982 --> 00:47:48,964
Show me "eva'dur."

420
00:48:05,518 --> 00:48:06,533
It's okay

421
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,665
Nell, Nell... the "eva'dur"
hits you like this, huh?

422
00:48:28,848 --> 00:48:30,277
Skoo'? "Skoo" in the belly?

423
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,214
Skoo'!

424
00:48:31,664 --> 00:48:32,591
Skoo'?

425
00:48:44,272 --> 00:48:47,501
Well, suppose your only close encounter
with men was terrifying violence?

426
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,924
Rape. You'd tell your daughter
they were monsters. Evil-doers

427
00:48:52,177 --> 00:48:54,184
- "Eva'dur."
- My God, of course!

428
00:48:54,257 --> 00:48:56,745
You'd want to warn her what they do.
I think Violet told Nell about rape

429
00:48:57,073 --> 00:48:58,055
Sure. but how?

430
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:04,364
"Skoo' inna belly."
Knife in the belly. Pardon me

431
00:49:05,329 --> 00:49:06,158
Skewer

432
00:49:06,993 --> 00:49:08,554
- Nell told you that?
- Yep

433
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:11,247
Well, that could be all that's keeping
her from coming out in the daytime

434
00:49:11,377 --> 00:49:13,232
A deliberately-implanted phobia

435
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:15,497
And why is she more likely
to be raped in the daytime?

436
00:49:15,538 --> 00:49:18,156
Well, she isn't, but she's more
likely to be seen in the daytime

437
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:20,108
And... Violet didn't
want anyone to see Nell

438
00:49:20,145 --> 00:49:21,639
Yep. I buy that

439
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,428
So...

440
00:49:24,945 --> 00:49:28,241
what do we do with phobics?
Get them to face what they're afraid of

441
00:49:28,818 --> 00:49:30,280
Neutralize their fear

442
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:35,666
We could do that

443
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:44,816
Hey. Uh-uh. not so fast

444
00:49:45,139 --> 00:49:48,401
- You're a man. You're an "eva'dur"
- Wait a minute, no, I'm not

445
00:49:49,427 --> 00:49:52,623
Ye-yes, I'm a, I'm a man.
I'm g-, I'm "ga'inja"!

446
00:49:54,003 --> 00:49:54,897
Ga'inja

447
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:59,793
Guardian angel!
I'm her guardian angel!

448
00:50:00,404 --> 00:50:03,851
Well, that's great.
Now you have to help

449
00:50:11,444 --> 00:50:12,426
Je'y!

450
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:21,264
Come on.
I want you right here beside me

451
00:50:21,908 --> 00:50:24,112
- You want a chaperone?
- For the record. Come on

452
00:50:25,013 --> 00:50:25,940
Okay

453
00:50:36,053 --> 00:50:37,067
Okay

454
00:50:38,229 --> 00:50:39,756
Now's as good a time as any

455
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:49,037
- Do I warn her, or what?
- Just do it. Act like it's no big deal

456
00:50:49,717 --> 00:50:51,343
Believe me, it's no big deal

457
00:50:58,037 --> 00:50:58,986
Turn around

458
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:47,508
He won't hurt you

459
00:52:50,426 --> 00:52:51,637
Who's Tirzah?

460
00:53:09,307 --> 00:53:10,354
Good, huh?

461
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:26,064
Je'y!

462
00:53:26,523 --> 00:53:27,505
What, Nell?

463
00:53:29,115 --> 00:53:30,130
These?

464
00:53:35,324 --> 00:53:36,306
Come and get it

465
00:53:38,268 --> 00:53:39,162
Come on

466
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:49,528
- Je'y!
- What, Nell?

467
00:53:51,388 --> 00:53:53,210
Well, come on nobody's
gonna hurt you

468
00:53:57,693 --> 00:53:58,773
Come and get some

469
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:12,437
See? No evil-doers. Just me

470
00:54:18,142 --> 00:54:20,476
Come on. scaredy. Come on!

471
00:54:22,302 --> 00:54:24,058
Well, what was you
doing back in that barn?

472
00:54:27,646 --> 00:54:29,785
The Wild Woman of Lake Coweeta!

473
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:36,630
- Well, what kind of wild?
- She was like an animal

474
00:54:38,463 --> 00:54:41,332
- She ain't got no clothes on?
- Butt fucking naked!

475
00:54:43,038 --> 00:54:44,762
And she does like a dog

476
00:54:58,015 --> 00:54:59,095
Hey, how are you doing?

477
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,604
What's going on?

478
00:55:06,879 --> 00:55:10,709
You say you was sawing
the wild woman in the wood

479
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,392
And what if I did?

480
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,236
- Well, I'd be interested
- Well, I'd be interested

481
00:55:31,425 --> 00:55:32,472
What's it called?

482
00:55:33,504 --> 00:55:34,006
Pop what?

483
00:55:34,112 --> 00:55:36,022
- Popcorn, Je'y
- Popcorn

484
00:55:42,945 --> 00:55:45,401
- What are you doing?
- Getting her out in the daytime

485
00:55:45,761 --> 00:55:48,150
- She's not a dog, for crissakes
- It works, doesn't it?

486
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:50,239
- Well, yeah, but...
- She's having a good time

487
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:53,335
She's discovered popcorn
Now she can go to the movies!

488
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:54,717
Nell?

489
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:57,751
Nay tata. Reckon?

490
00:56:22,818 --> 00:56:24,793
Oh, I knew she'd like it

491
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:35,418
T'ee...t'ee in the way!

492
00:56:51,076 --> 00:56:54,753
T'ee...t'ee in the way!

493
00:56:58,724 --> 00:56:59,804
Whoops

494
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:32,701
Nell!

495
00:57:51,078 --> 00:57:51,940
Nell!

496
00:57:57,606 --> 00:57:58,588
Damn it!

497
00:58:01,254 --> 00:58:02,432
Je'y?

498
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:05,185
Come loo' Mi'i!

499
00:58:06,406 --> 00:58:08,294
Where is "Mi'i", Nell?

500
00:58:08,647 --> 00:58:10,818
Mi'i inna missa feliss

501
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,083
Missa feliss?

502
00:58:13,671 --> 00:58:14,599
Come on

503
00:58:23,112 --> 00:58:24,039
Nell

504
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,647
Oh, my God

505
00:58:31,528 --> 00:58:32,476
Mi'i!

506
00:58:35,336 --> 00:58:36,416
Mi'i?

507
00:58:37,832 --> 00:58:39,686
"Mi'i" walks with the Lord

508
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,527
"Mi'i" walks with the Lord

509
00:58:43,944 --> 00:58:44,926
The Lord!

510
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,229
Lor-d

511
00:58:49,928 --> 00:58:50,877
That's it

512
00:59:01,161 --> 00:59:02,089
Reckon

513
00:59:16,714 --> 00:59:19,234
She's the survivor
of a pair of identical twins

514
00:59:19,338 --> 00:59:22,534
That's where the private language
comes from. It's twin-speech

515
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,708
- And this repetitive gesture?
- You got it

516
00:59:24,746 --> 00:59:27,234
So, how long ago did the twin die?

517
00:59:27,594 --> 00:59:32,297
Well, I'd guess the age of between six and
ten. We're looking at twenty years at least

518
00:59:32,906 --> 00:59:35,808
We want her in here, Paulajust
as soon as the court hearing's over

519
00:59:37,418 --> 00:59:39,523
Jerry thinks she
should be left where she is

520
00:59:40,715 --> 00:59:42,537
- Jerry?
- Dr. Lovell

521
00:59:44,170 --> 00:59:46,407
You know, Al, Nell has her
own way of doing things

522
00:59:46,443 --> 00:59:49,094
I'd say she can probably
handle it on her own

523
00:59:52,107 --> 00:59:55,554
Let me give you a little,
uh, peek into the future, Paula

524
00:59:56,299 --> 00:59:59,560
One day soon some...hiker or
fisherman is gonna come walking...

525
00:59:59,659 --> 01:00:01,896
out of those woods with
a story about a wild woman

526
01:00:02,411 --> 01:00:06,153
And, uh, that'll bring the news reporters.
The news reports will bring the crowds

527
01:00:06,251 --> 01:00:10,081
The crowds will bring the talk show hosts.
Nell will find she's hired a lawyer...

528
01:00:10,411 --> 01:00:12,801
an agent, a manager,
and three bodyguards

529
01:00:13,835 --> 01:00:14,948
You think she can handle that?

530
01:00:34,412 --> 01:00:35,492
Hello?

531
01:00:37,036 --> 01:00:38,280
Anybody home?

532
01:00:42,989 --> 01:00:44,068
Hello?

533
01:00:48,461 --> 01:00:49,639
Anybody home?

534
01:01:16,142 --> 01:01:17,255
Hi

535
01:01:20,078 --> 01:01:24,585
Mike lbarra. I'm ajournalist.
Charlotte Tribune

536
01:01:25,775 --> 01:01:28,645
Um... I heard you were living up here

537
01:01:29,583 --> 01:01:31,917
Well, I, I hope you
don't mind me coming by

538
01:01:34,575 --> 01:01:37,444
Look, is, uh... it okay if I...
I take a picture?

539
01:01:43,791 --> 01:01:45,679
Have you ever seen
one of these before?

540
01:01:46,288 --> 01:01:48,175
It, It's called a camera, see, and...

541
01:01:48,783 --> 01:01:52,460
um, uhh, I look at you...through
this little window here, see? Now...

542
01:01:52,623 --> 01:01:55,177
I'm looking at you through this...
window, and, uh...

543
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,622
Hey, no, come on, it's okay.
Really. It's okay...

544
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,102
You hurt her, you're dead, buddy!

545
01:02:05,137 --> 01:02:07,526
Look, I never touched her!
All I did was take her picture

546
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,756
You press?

547
01:02:12,817 --> 01:02:13,929
Charlotte Tribune

548
01:02:16,464 --> 01:02:20,010
Okay. I'm sorry.
I guess I overreacted

549
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:24,685
Look, I'm her doctor. Do me a favor,
will ya? Forget you ever met her

550
01:02:26,353 --> 01:02:27,368
Mike lbarra

551
01:02:28,657 --> 01:02:29,518
Lovell

552
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:32,622
Well, it's like this, Dr. Lovell

553
01:02:33,553 --> 01:02:34,502
I'm a newsman

554
01:02:35,281 --> 01:02:38,794
Yeah, well find some other news.
You saw how you scared her

555
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:53,515
Nell? You okay?

556
01:02:54,898 --> 01:02:56,786
- Nell?
- She's called Nell?

557
01:03:01,234 --> 01:03:04,911
She's called Nell?
She's called Nell?!

558
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,786
Why can't she just be left alone
to live as she damn well pleases?

559
01:03:08,914 --> 01:03:12,330
You know why. Once word gets out,
we might as well start selling tickets

560
01:03:12,627 --> 01:03:14,929
So what do we do, huh?
Build a wall around the woods?

561
01:03:15,635 --> 01:03:17,675
Well, maybe she's gonna
have to go somewhere else

562
01:03:19,507 --> 01:03:22,355
- Like where?
- Somewhere where she can be protected

563
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,394
Like a psychiatric unit, maybe?

564
01:03:24,564 --> 01:03:27,215
So what's your suggestion?
Check her into a Holiday lnn?

565
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,935
Al Paley's the best man in the field

566
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,241
Great. Let him stay in his field.
Nell doesn't need him

567
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,053
- So who does she need? You?
- She could do worse

568
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:38,066
Well, what have you got to offer?
What's your big plan for Nell?

569
01:03:38,132 --> 01:03:41,677
I don't make plans. That's your game.
Yours and Al's

570
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:43,947
Go play it somewhere else,
and leave us out of it

571
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:46,671
Oh, it's "us" now, is it?
Jerry and Nell, the happy couple?

572
01:03:46,932 --> 01:03:48,427
What would you
know about happy couples?

573
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,631
Well, what would you know about Nell?

574
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,696
I've spent more time
with her than you have

575
01:03:56,212 --> 01:03:57,674
Oh, yeah, I noticed

576
01:03:58,613 --> 01:03:59,823
What's that supposed to mean?

577
01:04:00,277 --> 01:04:03,059
You ever ask yourself why you
like hanging around Nell so much?

578
01:04:03,317 --> 01:04:06,285
- Great! Here we go again!
- She's not exactly a grown woman, is she?

579
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:09,007
- Not exactly a threat. Doesn't make any demands.
- You want to know what you problem is?

580
01:04:09,077 --> 01:04:10,572
- I'll tell you what your problem is
- Just what every man wants!

581
01:04:10,645 --> 01:04:11,791
- You're the big expert on men, right?
- You're not a man

582
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:13,739
- You're just a biob!
- What'd you do, read a book about it?

583
01:04:17,878 --> 01:04:18,739
God!

584
01:04:20,278 --> 01:04:22,187
Okay, Nell. It's okay

585
01:04:22,294 --> 01:04:24,847
Nell, Nell, Nell.
It's okay, it's okay. Nell

586
01:04:28,758 --> 01:04:30,416
Say something.
Make her feel it's okay

587
01:04:48,023 --> 01:04:49,779
Mommy loves Daddy, really

588
01:05:12,728 --> 01:05:14,484
Whatever I said back there...

589
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,588
I'm sorry, I was just sounding off

590
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,443
- It's okay
- What do I know?

591
01:05:22,296 --> 01:05:24,119
So what are we gonna do about Nell?

592
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,645
She's gonna have to take some kinda
competency test before a court hearing

593
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:36,568
Those tests don't prove a...

594
01:05:38,905 --> 01:05:39,799
I know

595
01:05:48,953 --> 01:05:52,336
It's time to show her the big bad world
and see how she handles it

596
01:06:03,962 --> 01:06:06,100
Okay. Hold still

597
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:10,133
Loo', Je'y. Jus' like Pau'

598
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:48,180
Slow down

599
01:07:29,437 --> 01:07:31,193
It's all right. It's noisy, though

600
01:07:57,983 --> 01:07:59,128
Mommy

601
01:08:11,678 --> 01:08:12,856
This is it, Nell

602
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,094
- Well, what do you say, Jerry?
- Hi, Todd

603
01:08:17,375 --> 01:08:18,423
You know Doctor Olsen

604
01:08:18,623 --> 01:08:20,663
- Oh, yeah. Hi
- Hey, how you doing?

605
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:23,549
- Well, look at this
- Nell this is Sheriff Peterson

606
01:08:24,383 --> 01:08:26,358
Uh, welcome to Robbinsville

607
01:08:26,847 --> 01:08:28,702
So how are you guys doing,
Todd? Okay?

608
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:33,532
- Ah, well quiet. Uh, I've known worse
- Hi, Mary?

609
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:40,155
Hi. All this is kinda new to her

610
01:08:40,864 --> 01:08:41,846
You scared?

611
01:08:44,256 --> 01:08:45,566
You scared?

612
01:08:45,856 --> 01:08:47,612
Well, you sleeping pretty
good up there in the mountains?

613
01:08:47,745 --> 01:08:49,370
I'm not as young as I used to be

614
01:08:50,912 --> 01:08:54,174
Well, we better get on home. Uh, looks
like you're doing good work there, Jerry

615
01:08:54,336 --> 01:08:55,318
Just starting

616
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:06,779
I'm not getting her this

617
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:09,602
She hasn't eaten junk like this yet,
and I'm not having her start now

618
01:10:09,636 --> 01:10:11,490
Don't you remember
eating candy as a kid?

619
01:10:12,132 --> 01:10:14,718
Saturday mornings, tearing
the wrapper off a Milky Way?

620
01:10:14,852 --> 01:10:18,049
The first explosion of total sweetness?
Life doesn't get any better

621
01:10:18,308 --> 01:10:20,162
- Right, Hazel?
- Yes

622
01:10:20,996 --> 01:10:23,746
- You still got all your own teeth?
- Yeah, mostly

623
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,082
Wher2's Nell?

624
01:10:28,676 --> 01:10:29,691
Nell?

625
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:30,874
Nell?

626
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:34,265
Nell?

627
01:10:38,533 --> 01:10:39,426
Nell?

628
01:11:15,782 --> 01:11:16,764
Jim!

629
01:11:17,415 --> 01:11:19,073
We got us a wild woman

630
01:11:20,774 --> 01:11:22,181
Flesh and blood

631
01:11:25,543 --> 01:11:27,168
Well, what does she want anyway?

632
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:31,652
Well, I tell ya,
I believe she wants a little action

633
01:11:33,031 --> 01:11:33,980
Get going, Billy

634
01:11:40,423 --> 01:11:41,470
Hi there, baby

635
01:11:44,648 --> 01:11:45,858
Anything I can do ya for?

636
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:58,758
Now, you'll have to excuse me.
Just correct me if I'm wrong here

637
01:11:58,888 --> 01:12:00,776
Miss... Miss Wild Thing, but you

638
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,836
you don't understand
a word I'm saying, do you?

639
01:12:06,568 --> 01:12:07,462
That's right

640
01:12:07,785 --> 01:12:14,375
You don't understand
a word that I'm saying, do you?

641
01:12:15,017 --> 01:12:16,032
That's right

642
01:12:16,425 --> 01:12:19,425
And it's getting a little bit
hot in here, Jim

643
01:12:20,873 --> 01:12:23,295
Why don't you just light my fire?

644
01:12:24,681 --> 01:12:28,096
You light my fire darling, that's right
Oh, that's it

645
01:12:28,329 --> 01:12:30,336
You want, you wanna
show me something?

646
01:12:30,665 --> 01:12:35,422
You, you want to show me them tit...?
Them are titties. Can you say "titties"?

647
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:39,177
Tit-, titties? Titties?

648
01:12:40,297 --> 01:12:43,843
That's right, shake 'em up.
That's right, turn all about, right

649
01:12:44,522 --> 01:12:47,839
That's a girl. Turn all around,
do the titty dance

650
01:12:48,138 --> 01:12:53,888
That's right. Hey! I got an idea. You
want to see my body? What you want?

651
01:12:59,275 --> 01:13:01,795
Whoo, titties! Titties!

652
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:06,535
Let's do the titty dance!
You put your left titty...

653
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:12,513
Put your right titty... No, no...
Put your right titty in...

654
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:15,873
Nell?

655
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:18,379
Nell!

656
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:27,271
What's going on here?

657
01:13:30,252 --> 01:13:32,008
What'd you do to her?!
What'd you do to her?!

658
01:13:32,043 --> 01:13:34,891
There don't have to be no ass-whupping.
You just take a look right over here

659
01:13:34,956 --> 01:13:36,363
She's just crazy.

660
01:13:58,093 --> 01:14:04,356
Nell, come on. Shh-shh-shh, Nell.
Shh. Come on. let's go, let's go

661
01:14:34,223 --> 01:14:37,157
- She still looking at it?
- Yeah

662
01:14:42,126 --> 01:14:43,621
Did your parents do this for you?

663
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:49,387
You gotta be kidding me. My mother'd
die before she'd give me a book like that

664
01:14:49,839 --> 01:14:51,246
No way. Uh-uh

665
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:53,316
So how'd you learn?

666
01:14:55,535 --> 01:14:57,575
Go on. Tell Dr. Lovell

667
01:15:00,367 --> 01:15:01,577
Girlfriends at school

668
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,887
So what about you?

669
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,949
- Well
- Come on, don't be shy. Come on

670
01:15:15,215 --> 01:15:16,525
Bathroom walls

671
01:15:16,592 --> 01:15:18,414
- Bathroom walls?
- Je'y?

672
01:15:19,376 --> 01:15:20,270
Nell?

673
01:15:20,304 --> 01:15:21,831
How yo' caw this?

674
01:15:32,688 --> 01:15:33,801
Well making love

675
01:15:36,432 --> 01:15:40,491
- Je'y?
- Well, not exactly

676
01:15:43,377 --> 01:15:44,359
Pau'?

677
01:15:45,873 --> 01:15:48,590
Yeah, that's right.
That's Jerry and Paula

678
01:15:59,185 --> 01:16:01,738
Making love

679
01:16:47,764 --> 01:16:50,699
It has to help Nell if we look on
as if we're getting along

680
01:16:51,252 --> 01:16:54,154
That's why I let her identify us with
the pictures. I hope you don't mind

681
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:55,504
Nope

682
01:16:56,276 --> 01:17:01,065
Research shows that children who perceive
their parents as having a good sex life...

683
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:04,402
grow up to make far better
sexual relationships themselves

684
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:06,449
Is that so?

685
01:17:08,308 --> 01:17:09,169
Yeah, that's so

686
01:17:15,572 --> 01:17:17,460
Did your parents have a good sex life?

687
01:17:18,613 --> 01:17:19,540
Three guesses

688
01:17:22,485 --> 01:17:23,434
What went wrong?

689
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:27,796
My daddy left home
when I was thirteen

690
01:17:29,109 --> 01:17:30,636
My mom still doesn't know why

691
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:34,064
She was always laughing and smiling

692
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:37,132
We were all supposed to be
having such a good time

693
01:17:40,246 --> 01:17:43,759
My dad liked happy people,
and so she was happy for him

694
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:48,270
She was so hurt. Shit

695
01:17:50,710 --> 01:17:51,954
You know what I hate?

696
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,994
The way we're all

697
01:17:57,622 --> 01:18:01,484
we're all trapped in these cycles,
going around and around

698
01:18:12,727 --> 01:18:15,345
I doesn't seem to me like
you're repeating the same pattern

699
01:18:16,407 --> 01:18:21,709
Oh, sure. I'm just playing the flip side,
right? Nobody's gonna hurt me, so...

700
01:18:22,263 --> 01:18:23,343
so I don't...

701
01:18:24,728 --> 01:18:26,222
I don't feel that much

702
01:18:27,608 --> 01:18:28,785
Even when I want to

703
01:18:30,744 --> 01:18:31,954
Shit!

704
01:18:53,721 --> 01:18:57,747
Nell, wha...?
Is anything the matter?

705
01:18:58,777 --> 01:19:00,784
An'thin' a' matter?

706
01:19:02,713 --> 01:19:04,535
An'thin' a' matter?

707
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:25,748
Donana kee

708
01:19:27,994 --> 01:19:29,652
I'm not, I'm not crying

709
01:19:49,339 --> 01:19:51,510
Oh, hell. Yes, I am

710
01:20:33,308 --> 01:20:34,257
Paula?

711
01:20:38,781 --> 01:20:39,763
Paula?

712
01:20:41,341 --> 01:20:42,323
You okay?

713
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:43,609
Fine

714
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:13,085
You wanna come?

715
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:17,885
Well, it's a pretty walk

716
01:21:22,142 --> 01:21:26,452
I just saw a T.V. news outfit in town.
It's not gonna take 'em long

717
01:21:26,654 --> 01:21:27,767
Listen to this

718
01:21:27,999 --> 01:21:32,058
"The wild woman never spent a dollar
in her life, but she's worth millions"

719
01:21:32,575 --> 01:21:33,884
Where do they get this shit?

720
01:21:36,031 --> 01:21:37,526
We have to get her outta here

721
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:44,726
The hospital

722
01:21:47,071 --> 01:21:49,657
You know it's the only place
where they can't get to her

723
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:53,115
Get away!
Get those cameras the hell outta here!

724
01:22:56,770 --> 01:22:57,753
Get away!

725
01:23:03,491 --> 01:23:05,880
Let her go, Mary. We have to go

726
01:23:09,027 --> 01:23:13,337
Nell, listen to me, Listen to me, Nell.
We have to leave! Just for a while

727
01:23:13,603 --> 01:23:18,143
Nell. I know you're scared...but I'll be
with you, I'll keep you safe. I promise

728
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,173
Nell...Jerry ga'inja

729
01:23:23,939 --> 01:23:27,201
- Je'y ga'inja
- That's right. Come on,

730
01:23:27,619 --> 01:23:28,863
Come on, we have to leave

731
01:23:29,156 --> 01:23:30,944
Okay? All right

732
01:23:53,188 --> 01:23:54,137
Hold on

733
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:09,084
Excuse me

734
01:25:12,551 --> 01:25:14,820
Almost there.
We're almost there

735
01:25:30,248 --> 01:25:33,631
Nell. Nell. Nell.
It's okay. Nell

736
01:25:38,921 --> 01:25:40,295
You'll have to carry her

737
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:45,694
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right...

738
01:25:46,633 --> 01:25:47,527
It's all right...it's all right, Nell

739
01:25:59,626 --> 01:26:01,448
It's all right...Nell

740
01:26:04,138 --> 01:26:05,185
It's all right...Nell!

741
01:26:09,674 --> 01:26:10,786
Nell!

742
01:26:14,538 --> 01:26:16,131
All right, all right, now let us take her.
Easy, easy, easy

743
01:26:16,490 --> 01:26:18,246
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, easy, wait!
Come on...

744
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:22,472
Back off! Back off!

745
01:26:26,282 --> 01:26:28,966
- Settle down, everybody, quiet!!!
- No sedatives

746
01:26:29,002 --> 01:26:29,951
We don't...want to set
the whole ward off here

747
01:26:29,995 --> 01:26:32,548
You can go in to see her
just as soon as you're... quiet

748
01:26:44,683 --> 01:26:47,138
Come on, Nell, It's Jerry

749
01:27:13,772 --> 01:27:15,976
This is not her normal behavior

750
01:27:16,173 --> 01:27:19,173
She hasn't freaked out like on this
for weeks, Al. You saw the damn tapes

751
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:20,962
I'm not happy about this, Paula

752
01:27:22,797 --> 01:27:25,252
She's out of her familiar environment

753
01:27:25,613 --> 01:27:26,987
You've had almost three months

754
01:27:27,629 --> 01:27:31,371
I want her in here, so we can begin what
we should have been doing from the start

755
01:27:31,661 --> 01:27:34,050
I must have been out of
my mind to bring her here

756
01:27:38,926 --> 01:27:40,486
She needs time, Al, that's all

757
01:27:44,845 --> 01:27:45,773
Come on

758
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:51,565
Well, we've got the weekend

759
01:27:53,422 --> 01:27:55,462
Maybe by Monday I'll feel happier

760
01:27:58,766 --> 01:27:59,660
Maybe not

761
01:28:17,903 --> 01:28:19,212
They'll shut you away!

762
01:28:19,855 --> 01:28:22,573
Show them how you really are!
Please

763
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:38,021
My beloved is gone
down into his garden

764
01:28:38,511 --> 01:28:41,610
to the beds of spices,
to feed in the gardens

765
01:28:42,576 --> 01:28:46,057
and to gather lilies.
I am my beloved

766
01:28:46,608 --> 01:28:48,135
and my beloved is mine

767
01:28:49,328 --> 01:28:51,215
he feedeth among the lilies

768
01:28:53,424 --> 01:28:57,483
"Thou art beautiful, O my love...
"...as Tirzah...

769
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:01,645
This isn't, uh, lower level autism,
that's for sure

770
01:29:33,746 --> 01:29:35,306
I want to take her out of here, Paula

771
01:29:35,922 --> 01:29:37,831
We can't. One more day, that's all

772
01:29:37,938 --> 01:29:40,621
You think the judge is gonna
say he knows better than Al Paley?

773
01:29:45,331 --> 01:29:47,534
- I'm taking her out
- Jerry!

774
01:29:47,571 --> 01:29:50,800
Come on, come on. You're gonna walk.
You're gonna walk. Here we go

775
01:30:01,651 --> 01:30:04,139
Come on. I'm talking you out of here.
I'm taking you out

776
01:30:12,243 --> 01:30:13,552
Hey, wait a second!

777
01:30:15,892 --> 01:30:17,418
- Move!
- Sorry

778
01:30:35,061 --> 01:30:36,435
No, not a word

779
01:30:39,924 --> 01:30:41,266
Yeah, I know

780
01:30:44,469 --> 01:30:45,549
Days lnn

781
01:30:47,989 --> 01:30:51,470
Six-oh-one North Tryon.
Room two-two-one

782
01:30:54,709 --> 01:30:56,979
No, we're not going anyplace

783
01:31:16,854 --> 01:31:18,862
I never meant it to be like this, Nell

784
01:31:22,967 --> 01:31:26,742
I'm not your guardian angel. Sorry

785
01:31:40,727 --> 01:31:43,313
But...Je'y feliss aw tye wi' Nell

786
01:31:49,111 --> 01:31:50,802
But I guess all that's over now

787
01:33:14,875 --> 01:33:19,763
Thou au beau'fu',
o ma love, as Tirzah

788
01:33:38,812 --> 01:33:40,241
How long she been like this?

789
01:33:41,852 --> 01:33:45,267
She's been out for over an hour now.
Just laid herself down and went to sleep

790
01:33:47,708 --> 01:33:48,569
Why here?

791
01:33:50,844 --> 01:33:52,371
I didn't know where else to go

792
01:34:04,285 --> 01:34:05,878
So what are we gonna do now?

793
01:34:09,853 --> 01:34:12,220
I'm gonna have to take her
to court tomorrow morning?

794
01:34:14,429 --> 01:34:15,323
Yes

795
01:34:17,533 --> 01:34:18,613
So that's it

796
01:34:20,349 --> 01:34:21,462
Shit

797
01:34:24,829 --> 01:34:29,401
I could...take it if she'd say something
to me. Anything but this silence

798
01:35:34,016 --> 01:35:37,846
Nell is on the threshold
of a hazardous journey

799
01:35:38,593 --> 01:35:40,316
We can guide her on thatjourney

800
01:35:40,576 --> 01:35:42,878
but what we can't do
is turn the clock back.

801
01:35:43,617 --> 01:35:45,275
She can never be a child again

802
01:35:46,465 --> 01:35:50,688
But, uh, we're not here to choose
between her new life and old life

803
01:35:51,393 --> 01:35:53,182
Her new life has already begun

804
01:35:53,665 --> 01:35:57,407
Our task here today is to determine
how we can best help her...

805
01:35:57,601 --> 01:36:00,448
as she takes her first steps
into a wilder world

806
01:36:00,737 --> 01:36:03,869
And in your opinion, Professor...
...Nell does need help?

807
01:36:04,577 --> 01:36:05,406
I don't think that's in doubt

808
01:36:05,441 --> 01:36:07,830
You don't think she's
capable of looking after herself?

809
01:36:08,034 --> 01:36:09,146
No, I do not

810
01:36:09,217 --> 01:36:11,389
What do you think she's been
doing for the last three months?

811
01:36:11,458 --> 01:36:14,175
It's my impression for the past three
months she's made no progress at all

812
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:16,666
Your counsel will have the opportunity
to put questions to the profes...

813
01:36:16,738 --> 01:36:18,811
What do you call progress?
Turning into someone like you?

814
01:36:18,850 --> 01:36:23,706
- No need to be personal here, Dr. Lovell
- I happen to like Nell, Professor

815
01:36:23,874 --> 01:36:26,045
What you do to her
is personal to me, okay?!

816
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:27,643
Counsel, you want to
control your client?

817
01:36:28,066 --> 01:36:31,001
You and Dr. Olsen have become
emotionally involved with your patient

818
01:36:31,075 --> 01:36:33,246
She is not my patient!
She is not sick!

819
01:36:33,283 --> 01:36:35,290
She throws fits.
She bangs her head against the wall

820
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:37,720
Oh, for God... It was a glass wall!
She didn't see it!

821
01:36:37,795 --> 01:36:39,322
Dr. Lovell, you will take your seat.

822
01:36:39,363 --> 01:36:41,567
She displays many of the symptoms of...
Asberger's Syndrome...

823
01:36:41,635 --> 01:36:43,807
Oh, bullshit!
She just doesn't want to talk to you!

824
01:36:43,843 --> 01:36:45,305
Does she want to talk to you, Dr. Lovell?

825
01:36:45,411 --> 01:36:47,004
Dr. Lovell, sit down!

826
01:36:58,596 --> 01:36:59,839
I...I'm sorry?

827
01:37:01,476 --> 01:37:02,458
Dr. Lovell?

828
01:37:05,508 --> 01:37:08,508
Je'y? Spee' fo Nell

829
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:23,290
She says, since her mother died,
she's been alone

830
01:37:26,853 --> 01:37:27,998
She's been afraid

831
01:37:41,445 --> 01:37:43,267
Everyone's frightened, everywhere

832
01:37:44,486 --> 01:37:46,308
The sweet Lord soothes our tears

833
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:48,378
Our many tears

834
01:37:57,286 --> 01:38:02,622
Our world has...many people in it, Nell.
People who can be your friends.

835
01:38:14,982 --> 01:38:17,088
But you have many things to learn

836
01:38:23,016 --> 01:38:24,325
Don't you want that?

837
01:38:33,831 --> 01:38:35,238
You have big things

838
01:38:46,088 --> 01:38:47,299
You know big things

839
01:38:51,688 --> 01:38:54,722
But... you don't
look into each other's eyes

840
01:39:00,297 --> 01:39:04,094
And you're...hungry for quietness

841
01:39:09,673 --> 01:39:11,167
I've lived a small life

842
01:39:14,217 --> 01:39:15,679
I know small things

843
01:39:18,025 --> 01:39:19,073
I know...

844
01:39:20,298 --> 01:39:21,410
loved ones

845
01:39:39,946 --> 01:39:41,288
I know everyone goes

846
01:39:46,762 --> 01:39:48,039
Everyone goes away

847
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:08,932
Yeah... I guess so

848
01:40:18,764 --> 01:40:20,258
Don't be frightened for Nell

849
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:24,517
Don't weep for her

850
01:40:29,837 --> 01:40:31,113
I have no...

851
01:40:35,276 --> 01:40:36,902
greater sorrows than you

852
01:40:39,308 --> 01:40:40,421
Yo'kay?

853
01:40:52,045 --> 01:40:53,387
Yo'kay?

854
01:41:19,854 --> 01:41:21,196
Is Ruthie still asleep?

855
01:41:23,695 --> 01:41:24,622
Yep

856
01:41:25,838 --> 01:41:27,147
Almost there

857
01:41:32,558 --> 01:41:34,468
Well, has everybody
got everything they need?

858
01:41:41,231 --> 01:41:42,955
Hey! What'd I tell you?

859
01:41:43,311 --> 01:41:45,732
You just start eating and
they'll show up. It never fails

860
01:41:46,191 --> 01:41:48,612
We finally made it!
I don't believe it!

861
01:41:51,376 --> 01:41:52,870
Happy birthday, Nell!

862
01:41:54,512 --> 01:41:55,559
Happy birthday

863
01:42:20,145 --> 01:42:22,033
Bass ain't hitting this stickbait today

864
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,520
Well, it ain't gonna hit nothing
if you don't hush up

865
01:42:26,097 --> 01:42:27,439
What you using, Don?

866
01:42:27,793 --> 01:42:30,989
Old spinner.
You know Mister Bass can't resist that

867
01:42:31,953 --> 01:42:36,361
I can't tell you how many times I seen
Myrtle Jean and Clara and the little baby...

868
01:43:03,922 --> 01:43:04,850
See that?

869
01:43:05,715 --> 01:43:08,617
And to think I was the big shot
who was gonna change her life

870
01:43:08,947 --> 01:43:10,191
You're not the only one

871
01:43:10,226 --> 01:43:14,733
But you did. Didn't you know?
You were the first

872
01:43:15,923 --> 01:43:17,036
The first what?

873
01:43:17,683 --> 01:43:18,796
To need her

874
01:43:44,052 --> 01:43:45,612
You remember that
