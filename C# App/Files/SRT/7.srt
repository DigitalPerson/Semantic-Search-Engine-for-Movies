00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:17,910
<i>Just before Pap died</i>

3
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,920
<i>He told me that I'd be fine as long as I never 
 depended on anybody but myself</i>

4
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,340
<i>I made Pap's grave just like 
 he had done Mama's.</i>

5
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,340
<i>All I had to remember her face 
 was one picture Pap kept.</i>

6
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,760
<i>but I can remember in the bed at night</i>

7
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,600
<i>keeping me warm from the other side</i>

8
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,030
<i>Pap said people passed on 
 and came back as some kind of animal</i>

9
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
<i>that the old part of them would 
 float around like smoke</i>

10
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,330
<i>and a person could burn 
 letters and talk to them that way</i>

11
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,500
<i>He said my momma was a 
 yellow finch now.</i>

12
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,620
<i>I mostly thought of her that way</i>

13
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,180
<i>I was 11 years old and Pap said he taught me 
 everything I needed to know</i>

14
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,520
<i>about living in the forest</i>

15
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:25,770
<i>When it came to fightin', he said he figured I could 
 whip someone 3 times my size..</i>

16
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,950
<i>but he mostly talked about the government</i>

17
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,070
<i>said they were after us</i>

18
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,280
<i>said they'd always be after us</i>

19
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,200
<i>and one day a war would come</i>

20
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,540
<i>and I'd have to fightem and be ready 
 to die for what was right</i>

21
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,450
Pap look!

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,120
What's that Pap?

23
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,070
-What are they doing Pap? 
 - Making a road.

24
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,320
Why?

25
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,770
Who are they, Pap?

26
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,770
I don't know.

27
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,070
Fill up the canteen. I'm going into town.

28
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,240
Yeah. Bring some vegetables 
 for us to sell?

29
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,030
We don't have time for that. 
 Fill up the canteen like I told you.

30
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,420
Pa, I did it!

31
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,720
- How are you, Ali? Moon? 
 - George

32
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,840
- What you two have for me today? 
 - Nothing.

33
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,890
What's going on with the dozers?

34
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,020
I hate to tell ya, Ali...

35
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,020
Heard that a lawyer from Birmingham 
 bought up a big track from the paper company.

36
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,020
12,000 acres

37
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,480
- They're going to build a big huntin' lodge. 
 - What else you know?

38
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,570
Oh, not much, just what I heard from a couple 
 fellows come in here to buy coats and such...

39
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,960
Do I get to buy anything? Pap!

40
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,040
You keep up, you hear me?

41
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,220
<i>Nothing was ever the same after 
 the bulldozers came.</i>

42
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,470
<i>Even though I watched his face, 
 I didn't know what Pap was thinking anymore.</ I ></i>

43
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,640
<i>Sometimes it was like, 
 he didn't know I was there.</i>

44
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,880
<i>A couple weeks passed before the 
 bulldozers grew silent.</i>

45
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,970
<i>We started hearing the hammering.</i>

46
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,010
<i>which made Pap even more nervous.</i>

47
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,390
<i>He got upset over the 
 smallest mistakes.</i>

48
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,560
Alright.

49
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,400
<i>We made one more trip to Mr. Aberscotti's store</i>

50
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,320
<i>when the vegetables ripened in the fall</i>

51
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,240
<i>That was the last time Pap left the forest alive.</i>

52
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,830
Ahh, South America's Andes. 
 lt and it's

53
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,950
...fringing islands...

54
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,080
- are basically a jagged... 
 - Stop reading outloud.

55
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,380
You're old enough to 
 read to yourself now.

56
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,790
Pa! Pa!

57
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,960
Help me!

58
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,010
Pa!

59
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,480
Help me!

60
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,930
Tell me again why we live out here.

61
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,190
Because you never ask for anything.

62
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,320
Nobody ever give us anything either.

63
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,620
Go on.

64
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,360
Because of that...

65
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,530
We don't owe anything to anybody.

66
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,410
Who it that thinks we owe them something?

67
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,080
The government.

68
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,210
I'm not gonna get any better.

69
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,850
What are we gonna do?

70
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,020
I'm not gonna make it.

71
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,360
You're gonna to die?

72
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,540
- When? Tonight? 
 - No. But soon.

73
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,960
This leg is gonna get infected

74
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,960
What will I do?

75
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,390
The paper company that owned this land

76
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,520
was too big to notice us out here.

77
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,770
But that new owner is gonna find you.

78
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
and he'll send the law.

79
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,860
You need to leave here, Moon...

80
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,110
and go find other people like us.

81
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,410
Most of them are out west, in 
 Montana, Colorado, Wyoming.

82
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,090
Alaska's even better.

83
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,840
A man can still homestead in Alaska

84
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,970
Find a place where nobody can find him.

85
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,140
You gonna have to find your 
 way up there, son.

86
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,520
- But how... 
 - You'll figure it out.

87
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,780
You can't rely on me anymore.

88
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,490
You just remember what I taught you.

89
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,030
And don't you trust nobody.

90
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,120
If you get lonely, you 
 can write me smoke letters.

91
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,290
But how will I get answers from the smoke?

92
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,630
I want to burn that picture of your mom 
 and put me and her both out of your head.

93
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,890
You'll feel lonely for awhile...

94
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,560
but it will go away if you ain't 
 carrying things to set it off.

95
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,520
How will I get anwers from 
 the smoke Pap?

96
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,360
You just do what I tell you, son

97
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:21,530
- I don't want you to die! 
 - Shut up my boy, you don't cry.

98
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,040
You hear me? 
 You'll be alright.

99
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,170
I don't want to hear anymore about it.

100
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,860
<i>After I buried Pap, 
 I felt the lonliness he told me about</i>

101
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,070
<i>crawlin' up my stomach 
 and up into my throat.</i>

102
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,740
<i>lt didn't seem like anything 
 that would go away anytime soon.</i>

103
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,930
Dear Pap, I'm gonna start 
 for Alaska tomorrow.

104
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,980
Maybe you can talk to me soon.

105
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Pap!

106
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,930
Pap! Wait, Pap!

107
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,480
Pap! Pap!

108
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,610
Easy now, easy.

109
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,620
I not gonna hurt you.

110
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,960
You're the boy the store owner 
 told me about, aren't ya?

111
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,000
Where's your father?

112
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,340
I buried him. He's dead.

113
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,510
When did that happen?

114
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,600
Yesterday.

115
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,770
- I shouldn't be here. 
 - Hold on, where do you plan to go?

116
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,770
I gotta get away from the law.

117
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,110
How about some food?

118
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,370
I've got a sweet roll that's 
 sittin' on the counter in there.

119
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,080
You stay right here. 
 I'll be right back with it.

120
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,410
Take it easy.

121
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,420
We're just trying to help.

122
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,760
You should've grabbed that boy!

123
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,760
Rabbit

124
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,020
Pap was right. The 
 law was after me.

125
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,060
I'll have to make to Alaska.

126
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,510
Where you think you're going, boy?

127
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,520
Where'd you bury your daddy?

128
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,980
You know you cant just go off buring 
 people without the law involved.

129
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,900
I know a thing or two 
 about trackin'.

130
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,530
I'll find your stick hut.

131
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,700
Ahh, reach for it and 
 see what happens boy

132
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,950
I didn't do nothing to nobody!

133
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,080
Ahh, quit bowing up to me

134
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,130
Now get in the car before 
 I knock you sideways.

135
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,380
- Get in the car 
 - No

136
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,850
Settle down!

137
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,930
Come on boy, get in the car. 
 Get in there!

138
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,470
Where are we going?

139
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,480
Where are we going?!

140
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,610
When will I get my things back?

141
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,770
When ready to give'em

142
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,860
Can't help but think I'll be seeing you 
 in and out of jail your whole life, boy.

143
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,080
Pure bread white trash.

144
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,120
Don't need that in my town.

145
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,330
People like your pap. Poachin' 
 and trespassin' for a livin'.

146
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,500
Don't you ever talk mean about Pap! 
 Ever!

147
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,130
Well what ya goin' do about it?

148
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,590
That's what I thought.

149
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,780
Go!

150
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,920
Open the gate

151
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,640
Where is your daddy, kid?

152
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,860
Man, can you believe it's really him?

153
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,110
This way boy.

154
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,530
Alright, back on the line, 
 let's go.

155
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,240
Thank you Constable Sanders, the boy 
 will be safe in our care.

156
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,040
You best put restraints on this 
 boy before I leave.

157
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,580
- I don't think he's going anywhere. 
 - I telling you, this kid's an animal

158
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,750
He'll be on you like a wet cat 
 you do not tie him down.

159
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,880
This is our watchman, Mr. Carter.

160
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,970
He'll handle Moon from here.

161
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:25,180
A wet cat.

162
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,770
Mr Carter, get this boy a 
 uniform and show him to his bunk.

163
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,600
Come on son.

164
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,570
The rest of the residents are in 
 the school trailers right now.

165
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,700
You got 16 boys in your bunk room.

166
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,540
Chances are, 
 you'll find a friend.

167
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,870
I'm not going to be here 
 long enough to need friends.

168
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,960
I'm busting out. 
 Soon as I find a way.

169
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,010
You better get that 
 out of your head.

170
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,090
You'll be fine and learn to like it.

171
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,390
Just follow the rules. 
 Come on.

172
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,390
What's this for?

173
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,600
You haven't started yet?

174
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,820
Turn that lever. 
 Let's go.

175
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,560
Find bunk 14. 
 That's you.

176
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,730
Those other boys will be comin' 
 out of class soon.

177
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,820
They come through here 
 to clean up for supper.

178
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,950
You hitch a ride with them 
 to the mess hall, alright?

179
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,270
You the one 
 all over the news?

180
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,280
Well, I don't know 
 about any of that.

181
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,530
- It said you fought a cop. 
 - I didn't want to go with him.

182
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,750
- He don't look so tough to me. 
 - I could whip you.

183
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:56,910
Fight! Fight! Fight!

184
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,830
Fight! Fight! Fight!

185
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,300
Everybody! To your bunks. 
 Now!

186
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,970
Whatta you do to him?

187
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,020
Well I hit in the balls 
 as hard as I could.

188
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,230
He curled up on the floor all on his own.

189
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:20,560
I guess you weren't 
 provoking him, were you Hal?

190
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,650
That's what I thought.

191
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,940
I'm tired of you mouth 
 and your trouble.

192
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,070
You be sleepin' outside again tonight, 
 without any supper.

193
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,410
The rest you... 
 go back to your business.

194
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,370
Miss Broomstead will ring the supper 
 bell in 10 minutes.

195
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,520
I can sit here?

196
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,950
My name is Kit

197
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,250
So ahh... How's your first day going?

198
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,720
Thanks

199
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:37,850
- What's that? 
 -uhh...my pills.

200
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,980
- Are they any good? 
 - No, it's medicine.

201
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,150
I have to take them 
 my whole life.

202
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,090
Yeah...you're supposed to put 
 those on to sleep in.

203
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,470
- How come? 
 - that's just the rules.

204
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:18,470
You put your uniform in the locker 
 that says 14, like your bunk.

205
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,940
- Hey, where are you going? 
 - Outside.

206
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,110
- Why? 
 - To sleep.

207
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,030
No. Hal's out there. 
 He wants to kill you!

208
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,150
- Oh yeah, I know. He already told me. 
 - No Moon!

209
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,320
Mr. Carter is not here to save you.

210
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,920
- What are you doing here? 
 - I like it better ouside.

211
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,960
Go to sleep in my bed. 
 Pretend to be me.

212
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,970
- You crazy? 
 - No. I just like it better outside.

213
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,220
Well...Mr. Carter is gonna 
 kick my ass if he catches me.

214
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,270
And maybe yours is too.

215
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,350
Well you just go snuggle up 
 nice in those covers.

216
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,940
Yeah. Alright.

217
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,450
OK, OK, slow down. I mean 
 you're going to make yourself sick.

218
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,490
I never had all I 
 can eat before.

219
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,500
Hey. I don't think Hal's 
 mad at you anymore.

220
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:58,130
Since he's almost 14. I mean...they send you to a place 
 called Hellenwilder when you're 14.

221
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,300
You know...not everybody's 
 mean like Hal.

222
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:07,390
- You can make some friends here 
 - I never had friends.

223
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,690
Well uh...

224
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,860
I could be your friend.

225
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,290
- Who's that? 
 - Oh, that's uh...that's Rachel.

226
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,410
- She's Mr. Gene's daughter. 
 - She lives here?

227
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:34,170
No no no no ummm. She lives out back 
 in Mr. Gene's house on the weekends...

228
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,880
...and lives with her mom during the week.

229
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,220
Okay...don't tell anyone...I mean no one...

230
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,340
...she and Hal have been kissing 
 through the player in the fence.

231
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,470
ewww.

232
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,640
I bet Mr. Gene hates that.

233
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,730
Yeah...ah, you know 
 he kinda doesn't know.

234
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,110
Need you to come with me after breakfast

235
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,280
Mr. Gene wants to see you.

236
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,410
There you are, Moon

237
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,620
That's mine. 
 Give it back.

238
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,000
We'll keep all your things in a safe 
 place for you.

239
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,550
What's on my hat?

240
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,470
You mean this?

241
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,730
This is not part of the Pinson uniform.

242
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,400
Those are your school books 
 for Monday morning.

243
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,520
Take them and have a seat.

244
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,030
I hear you have plans 
 to run away?

245
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,280
Let me tell you about Pinson.

246
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,540
First of all, we've never had 
 anyone escape,

247
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,580
or bust out as you put it.

248
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,790
And second of all, you are now 
 property of the state

249
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
and will remail so until you turn 
 18 years of age.

250
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,840
Look at me when I'm 
 speaking to you.

251
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,970
If, someone comes to claim you, 
 you will be released into their custody.

252
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,340
Do you understand?

253
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,140
If you behave, you 
 will have no problems here.

254
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,440
But any more talk of escape, then 
 your stay here will not be pleasant.

255
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,480
- Alight. 
 - Alright what?

256
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,820
- I won't talk about it anymore. 
 - Very well.

257
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,030
Go put your books away 
 and report to the kitchen

258
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,870
to see Mrs. Broomstead 
 to get that hair cut.

259
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,710
Don't cut it short.

260
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,970
Me and Pap always wear it long 
 in the winter to keep warm.

261
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,220
You don't have to worry about that here.

262
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,470
I don't plan on 
 staying long.

263
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,350
We'll see about that.

264
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,390
Better not be any 
 bugs in here.

265
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,940
there's no bugs in here.

266
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,520
Better not be.

267
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,290
- Okay? 
 - Looks good.

268
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,380
- Hey. 
 - Hey.

269
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:23,670
I heard about you. You're that 
 boy that lived in the forest.

270
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,720
- Right? 
 - Ahhh, yeah.

271
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,680
Rachel.

272
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,470
What did I tell you?

273
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,640
I just said hey to him.

274
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:34,060
Get outside. Or go 
 watch TV the house.

275
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,570
Pitch it here. Over here.

276
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,070
- He's over there. 
 - Yeah, I see him. Let's go get him.

277
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,780
- Hey, did Mr. Gene get mad at you? 
 - No, he gave me some books.

278
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,370
Yeah, the're for 
 school on Monday.

279
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,460
I won't need them. I'm going over 
 the fence tonight.

280
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,420
You wanna come?

281
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,250
- Hey, you can't make it over the fence. 
 - Sure I can, I figured out a way.

282
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,710
We'll find some woods to hide 
 in til spring.

283
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,380
then we'll head for Alaska.

284
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,880
Yeah. Will it just be us?

285
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,930
We need a big guy like 
 Hal to drive us out of here.

286
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,060
Moon, Hal hates both of us.

287
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,350
- I'll go talk to him. 
 - But Moon...

288
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,190
It was all stuck together.

289
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,490
- I ain't mad at you anymore. 
 - I'm not worried about that.

290
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,740
I need to talk to you.

291
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,660
Alone.

292
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,540
Catch you guys later.

293
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,880
- You know how to drive. 
 - Sure

294
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,880
Dad taught me a lot about cars.

295
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,880
Good. 
 Because I'm busting out tonight.

296
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,180
- We need someone to drive us. 
 - I knew you were crazy

297
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,010
You ain't gettin' out of here.

298
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,050
Yes I am. 
 And I'm not crazy.

299
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,350
- What's your problem? 
 - Hey. I'm coming too.

300
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:04,650
You kiddin'? You can't go 
 a day without medicine.

301
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:05,820
You don't know about me Hal!

302
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,030
Moon says he can make medicine from 
 things he finds in the forest.

303
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,990
You sure you don't 
 need your pills?

304
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,160
Nah, I don't need them.

305
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,490
No, they don't do anything anyway.

306
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,580
Fine then. If he's coming, 
 I'm bringing Rachel.

307
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:27,710
You got a plan or something? 
 This big escape.

308
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,480
And we're out!

309
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,610
What about Rachel?

310
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,700
Yeah. We'll get her.

311
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,370
- You sure? 
 - Yeah.

312
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,210
We're good.

313
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,810
Come on.

314
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,530
Right there, right there.

315
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:44,960
Here, take my blanket!

316
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,210
Kit.

317
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,220
Come on, hurry.

318
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,260
Here's the other one, 
 just saw it up there

319
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,470
- Hurry, Moon. 
 - Here, grab this.

320
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,560
- You got it? 
 - Yeah.

321
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,740
- Moon, what do we do? 
 - Come on, just help me lift this up.

322
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,160
Get it! Come on!

323
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,450
Alright, we're almost there.

324
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,660
Last screw.

325
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,710
Alright. Alright guys. 
 Come on, now we just gotta lift it.

326
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,260
Alright now. 
 Kit go.

327
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:46,350
Now Hal, follow him.

328
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
As soon as you get to the edge, 
 just jump off.

329
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,650
YES!

330
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,900
- Hal, come on, it's easy. 
 - Hal, jump.

331
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,910
Come on Hal, jump.

332
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,120
Alright. Come on Moon. 
 Let's go.

333
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,160
What about everybody else?

334
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,250
What about 'em?

335
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,340
- Well I figured they'd all wanna come. 
 - What?

336
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,670
- You can't be serious. 
 - Yeah. Go get the bus, Hal.

337
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,590
I'll be right back.

338
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,680
My butt is so caught.

339
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,150
Wake up everybody!

340
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,360
We're busting out of here! 
 Come on!

341
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,570
YEAH!

342
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,610
C'mon, guys.

343
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,610
Come on.

344
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,790
Come on.

345
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,970
This is so wild. 
 Daddy's going to be so mad.

346
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,310
You guys get them to shut the hell 
 up and just stop rockin' the bus.

347
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,560
They're going crazy back here, Hal. 
 - Yeah, I know!

348
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,600
- Where we going, Moon 
 - To the woods!

349
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,570
- Where will we live? 
 - We will make a giant shelter with traps.

350
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,530
- and catch food 
 - Yeah!

351
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,070
- And we won't have to go to school everyday! 
 - Yeah!

352
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:08,160
- And we'll whup up on anybody who tries to catch us! 
 - Yeah!

353
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:11,290
You guys stop screaming and 
 tell me where the hell I'm going?

354
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,290
To the woods, Hal.

355
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,420
Great plans, 
 I don't even know what road I'm on.

356
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,630
There's a sign. Talladega 
 National Forest.

357
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,630
Yeah yeah, go to 
 that one, Hal?

358
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,880
This is crazy

359
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,470
Yeah!

360
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,190
- How much further Moon 
 - Just right up here.

361
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,040
Wake up everybody. 
 We're as far as we can go.

362
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,210
The forest is all around us.

363
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,340
I don't wanna bust 
 out anymore.

364
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,010
Yeah, Mr. Gene is going 
 to be mad about this.

365
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,600
But I thought everybody wanted to come.

366
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,850
Let'em stay, Moon. I don't want 
 to deal with a bunch of cry babies.

367
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:16,980
- You're coming, aren't you Kit? 
 - Of course I'm coming.

368
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,110
Alright. You can go on and 
 I'll stay with them

369
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,320
But I thought we were gonna 
 to go in the woods together.

370
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,450
I have cheerleading on Monday.

371
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,530
and I just wanted to come 
 along for the bus ride.

372
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,580
Everybody who wants 
 stay, Rachel going to be here.

373
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,790
The law's going to come around before long. 
 They'll take you back.

374
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,080
What makes you so sure, Moon?

375
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,920
The law's always after me.

376
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,430
- What you doing in there? 
 - Kissing her?

377
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,770
She wants to give you a good 
 luck kiss. One the cheek.

378
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:02,860
- How long is that going to take? 
 - It better not take long.

379
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,840
Come on guys. 
 Let's just go.

380
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,010
Yes, sir.

381
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,270
Yes, sir.

382
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,560
They located the bus and 
 everyone is safe.

383
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,650
Yes, sir. 
 Well, all but three.

384
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,860
I know.

385
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,740
I know. 
 We're doing what we can sir.

386
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,700
Yes, sir.

387
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:58,080
I hope you can track him down like he 
 said. I'm about to lose my job.

388
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:01,170
My schedule is pretty busy 
 for the next couple days.

389
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,170
This means a lot to me.

390
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,460
- A lot. 
 - Well in that case...

391
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,720
I might be able to rearrange 
 my case load.

392
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,720
Just do what you gotta do.

393
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,850
I'll tell you you what 
 you gotta do.

394
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:21,190
You gotta treat and 
 animal like an animal.

395
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,190
That boy needs dogs on him

396
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,270
and a leash to bring him back with

397
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,360
and then, you've gotta put restraints on that boy 
 like I told you when I first brought him.

398
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,450
Okay.

399
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,410
From this point forward, 
 we're gonna do things my way

400
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,660
on my terms.

401
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:41,830
- Goodbye 
 - Goodbye

402
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,810
Let's go Snapper, 
 find him.

403
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,770
Find him boy. Come on! 
 Let's go to work.

404
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,710
- How much further? 
 - We can not stop now

405
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,750
we gotta get to where 
 nobody can find us.

406
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,930
- All right, Kit? 
 - I'm fine, Moon.

407
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,140
Come on. 
 Let's go.

408
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:48,690
- When do we eat? 
 - Soon.

409
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,780
Quick, dogs! Come on guys, 
 quick. We gotta cover our steps.

410
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,510
There you go boy!

411
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,800
Come back here Snapper!

412
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,400
Snapper!

413
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:41,990
Didn't work, 
 it's heading up the creek.

414
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:43,950
Crap! 
 Now what?

415
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,000
You two go hide in the bushes!

416
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,210
- What about you, Moon? 
 - I'm gonna fight it.

417
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,630
Fight it? 
 Hell, you can not fight a dog!

418
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,920
I ain't going back to Pinson 
 and neither are you.

419
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,050
Come on, Kit, 
 do what you whatever you want.

420
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,150
Watch your head.

421
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,580
Stay! Stay back! 
 Stay! Stay! Stay back!

422
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,960
You're a good dog, 
 come on.

423
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,920
Come here, boy.

424
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:36,960
- No, stop it! 
 - We gotta do something!

425
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,050
- That dog's killing Moon. 
 - Get off me!

426
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,180
Get away from me. 
 Help! Somebody help!

427
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,220
Ahhh...heel.

428
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,100
- Get him off of me! 
 - You're okay, he looks like a Nice dog.

429
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:52,520
Stop! 
 Some bloodhound.

430
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,730
He wants to stay with us.

431
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,320
Yes he does. 
 That's a good boy.

432
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:04,530
Snapper!

433
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,290
Get back here, 
 you dumb blood!

434
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:33,230
Snapper. 
 Davy Sanders, Gainesville Alabama

435
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,480
Sanders is out there and his 
 dog doesn't like him either.

436
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,610
- Who's Sanders? 
 - The Law.

437
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,740
Great, now the law's 
 after us.

438
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,450
That is good, 
 they'll have a hard time finding us way out here.

439
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,000
- Look Hall, I did it! 
 - Great!

440
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,080
I'm just waiting for the food 
 part of all this.

441
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,340
- I can feel him, he's somewhere around here. 
 - Yeah.

442
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,810
Put it over there by the light, 
 I think he's moving.

443
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,980
- Oh gosh, that's so cool 
 - Told you I'd catch something.

444
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,190
- Yeah. What kind is it? 
 - A catfish

445
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,950
- You were hungry, weren't you boy? 
 - Hey, he sure does like you Hal.

446
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:27,490
Yeah, well, I ain't one to be 
 mean to dogs.

447
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:30,410
You feel better now that 
 you ate all that fish, don't ya?

448
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,710
- It was pretty good. 
 - I thought it was great.

449
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,130
Enjoy while you can. See how long 
 you can last out here without your medicine.

450
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,130
I don't need my medicine Hal. 
 You'll find that you're so... 
 *****************check book? what he'd say????

451
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,260
How'd you get to Alabama 
 anyway Kit?

452
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:50,430
I was sent from Boston to live with 
 my Aunta Montgomery.

453
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,480
by the time I got 
 there, she'd...

454
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,730
she died. Then I got sent 
 to a hospital again in Birmingham

455
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:01,860
well then they took me to 
 a place in Selma.

456
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,200
You know, I was in the hospital for so 
 long, they just never sent me back.

457
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:09,830
That's what they call real 
 property of the state, Moon.

458
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,040
So are you Hal...

459
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,500
From now on, you guys won't have 
 to worry about any of this

460
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:14,460
any more.

461
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:16,620
I'd been fine if they'd just 
 let me stay with my daddy.

462
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:19,670
I mean, he may have been drunk all the 
 time, but is the best dad there is.

463
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:27,970
You know, I just don't want to go back 
 to another hospital ever again.

464
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,140
I don't want more needles in my back. 
 And I don't want my hair falling out.

465
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:34,350
Do not worry, Kit.

466
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,560
Just figure another half day before we start 
 looking for places to make permanent camp.

467
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,690
We just gotta get 
 ahead of Sanders first.

468
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,700
Do you think he can 
 make it all this way, Moon?

469
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,950
- Not really, no. 
 - Good Night

470
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,040
- Goodnight. 
 - Goodnight.

471
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:41,920
- What's that? 
 - It's a pig trap.

472
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,210
- For trappin' wild pigs. 
 - Pig trap?

473
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,260
Moon, does that mean they're 
 people around?

474
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:50,260
Nah, too over grown. 
 Hasn't been used in years.

475
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,550
But maybe we can clean 
 it out and use it again.

476
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,600
Wild pigs are awful 
 good eatin'.

477
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,020
- There look, puma tracks. 
 - Pumas? Moon, you gotta be kidding me.

478
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,730
First wild pigs and 
 and now pumas.

479
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,100
They won't hurt anything our size.

480
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,900
Pap said they need at 
 least 30 square miles of territory.

481
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,360
So...that means we're 
 far from any people?

482
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:14,330
We'll make permanent camp on 
 the south side of the ravine.

483
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:17,580
Then we'll start 
 our training for Alaska.

484
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,180
- Oh, thanks. 
 - Here you go Moon.

485
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,430
Ohh, thank you.

486
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,650
That better not be rain.

487
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,030
We'll finish making 
 the shelter tomorrow

488
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,160
then we'll make traps 
 to catch food.

489
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,330
- and then we'll... 
 - Shut up, Moon!

490
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,800
Ummm shoot!

491
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:23,140
- Hey Moon. 
 - Looks good.

492
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,810
Where's Hal?

493
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:29,570
He left.

494
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,030
Where'd he go?

495
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,950
He said he was going 
 home to live with his daddy.

496
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,780
Home?

497
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,910
How long has he been gone?

498
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,750
Hal.

499
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,750
Hal.

500
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,670
Hal.

501
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,550
Think Hal's gonna make it?

502
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,680
Hal's gonna make it.

503
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:57,600
He's got that trackin' dog.

504
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,720
They'll find their way back.

505
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,060
I just wanted to see his daddy.

506
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:09,110
I know.

507
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,490
I want that too.

508
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,360
I'd stay here no matter what.

509
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:19,580
This is where I wanna be, Moon

510
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:31,960
This is called a 4 trap.

511
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:35,090
The animal is walking along, 
 goes for the food and...

512
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,390
Dead.

513
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,100
Dinner. 
 But you have to cook it.

514
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,480
I'm still working on the fire.

515
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,560
Ahh. Well right now you gotta 
 help me get this up.

516
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:12,750
Good.

517
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,310
- Kit! He's out there, I saw him! 
 - Who?

518
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,390
Sanders. He's tireing out for 
 someone to come find him.

519
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,440
I think he's been lost out 
 her all this time.

520
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,610
Whatta we do?

521
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:34,030
We get his gun and 
 then we get rid of him.

522
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:34,690
Moon!

523
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,780
- What? 
 - We can't kill him. He's a police man.

524
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:40,240
I ain't gonna kill him. 
 We're just gonna whip upon him some.

525
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:45,120
Now, you go get some really long 
 thin sticks while I go gather some leaves.

526
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:16,320
Whoa Hey! 
 Whoa whoa whoa!

527
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:18,530
Hold on there little buddy.

528
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:22,110
You best hand me that pistol 
 before you hurt yourself, ya hear?

529
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:23,620
Huh?

530
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,830
You're causing me a 
 lot of trouble, boy!

531
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:38,970
That's a five hundred 
 dollar gun boy!

532
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:42,510
If I catch you boy, 
 you're done!

533
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,680
Get back here, boy!

534
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,690
Get back here, boy!

535
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,280
So...you finally 
 give up do ya?

536
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:08,410
Yep. You're just too darn smart 
 for me Constable Sanders.

537
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,660
Come on, arrest me.

538
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:13,830
Ahh. I'll get around to it.

539
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:17,750
First...you need a little ass whippin'.

540
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:21,970
Yeah!

541
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,470
Just wait till I 
 get out of this!

542
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,890
By then we'll be miles away 
 and you'll be too busy

543
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,350
itching and scratching 
 to chase anything.

544
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:34,650
Huh?

545
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,190
That's poison oak.

546
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,860
Nearest way out of 
 these woods is

547
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,940
that way. A highway 
 about 6 miles away.

548
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:44,820
If you hurry, you can just about 
 make it before dark.

549
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:46,870
You come back here. 
 You come back here, boy!

550
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:49,160
Come on.

551
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,970
<i>Kit was quick to learn 
 everything I taught him.</i>

552
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:17,270
<i>It got to where I had to 
 show him less and less.</i>

553
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,740
<i>With all the game we trapped, 
 we had plenty of food.</i>

554
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:31,740
- This is so good 
 - I know

555
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:38,210
<i>I reminded him, 
 that when spring came</i>

556
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,800
<i>and the cold winter moved on, 
 we'd head to Alaska.</i>

557
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:52,720
<i>The weather was warm 
 most days.</i>

558
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,730
<i>I'm figured the worst part 
 of winter was over</i>

559
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,020
<i>but I'm wrong.</i>

560
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:11,410
Here, this will keep you warm.

561
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,050
Thanks.

562
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,640
I'm gonna go get you some 
 medicine. Hang in there, buddy.

563
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,880
Here Kit.

564
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:13,970
Eat this. 
 It will make you feel better.

565
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,140
Hey, Kit.

566
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,610
Thanks, Moon

567
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:36,910
I do not want 
 you to die.

568
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,170
- I'm okay 
 - You''re not.

569
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:52,470
I'm gettin' you out 
 of here...tonight.

570
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,180
We made it Kit.

571
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:22,220
We'll wait here for help.

572
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,190
They'll come and take you 
 to get more medicine.

573
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,480
I will be waiting out 
 here for you here, Kit.

574
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:33,900
I'll bust in under 
 the new way.

575
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:43,200
What's happened here, son?

576
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:46,210
Get him his medicine.

577
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,940
- Counts good. Mic check, 1,2,3,4. 
 - Sounds good.

578
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:09,270
Yesterday the boy they 
 call Alabama Moon

579
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,360
brought one of its two other escapees 
 from the Pinson Boy's Home

580
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:14,190
to this place 
 for medical attention.

581
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:17,530
The sick boy is now being treated 
 at a Tuscaloosa hospital.

582
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:21,160
It's belived that the third escapee, 
 Hal Mitchell, is still at large

583
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,200
with Alabama Moon in 
 the forest behind us.

584
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:26,330
Moon Blake was wanted for 
 evasion of the law and,

585
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:29,040
attempt of murder of a police officer.

586
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,210
This is Nancy Cynder, 
 Action 4 news.

587
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:32,800
We're good. 
 That was perfect, Nancy.

588
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,130
Yeah. 
 Sounded good.

589
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,670
- What are you doing in there? 
 - Waiting for Kit.

590
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:16,340
- Come to live with me again? 
 - No, I got my daddy with me.

591
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,090
I ain't never seen 
 such a critter.

592
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:25,260
Boy they're huntin' you all over. 
 Better get in here.

593
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,480
But I told Kit 
 I'd wait for him.

594
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,480
Hell, you're gonna 
 have a long wait

595
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:32,770
radio says they got'em in the hospital 
 stuck full of all kinds of stuff.

596
01:03:32,770 --> 01:03:35,650
It's okay, Moon, he's just 
 gotta get back on that medicine.

597
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:37,820
I mean we came out here 
 to warn you about Sanders.

598
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:39,650
He ain't lettin' 
 up on you.

599
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:42,160
You need to find someplace 
 else to hang out for a while.

600
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,990
I ain't afraid of Sanders.

601
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,200
He's been on the radio saying that 
 you shot at him and ate his dog, Moon.

602
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:48,410
- But I didn't do that. 
 - I know.

603
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:52,380
I've been drawin' down of 
 my savin's trying to feed that bloodhound.

604
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,790
Come on.

605
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,400
Here it is Moon.

606
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,530
Home Sweet Home.

607
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:23,820
- Wow! This is great! 
 - Yeah, just like the Beverly Hillbillies.

608
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:26,490
- This is where you live? 
 - Yeah.

609
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:27,910
Whatta ya think of that Moon?

610
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,290
Amazing!

611
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:30,790
This is all yours?

612
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:32,790
Me and the bank.

613
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,170
Snapper!

614
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:45,720
Show him around, Hal.

615
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:47,680
Here it is.

616
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:48,930
Wow!

617
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:51,810
It's really nice!

618
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,850
Let's get you cleaned up.

619
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:04,530
- Hey, Moon, come on. 
 - Whatta ya doing?

620
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:07,450
Get in. You ain't the 
 only one who knows about stuff.

621
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,040
Faster!

622
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:22,090
- Whatta ya think of this? 
 - Most fun I ever had!

623
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,930
I gotta chain saw too. 
 Bet you've never used one of them.

624
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:28,050
Let's go get it!

625
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:54,410
Here you go, boy.

626
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:57,580
Yeah, it's a touch easier than killin' 
 your own food, ain't it Moon?

627
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:58,630
Yes, sir.

628
01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:00,920
I can ride around in clay 
 pits and use chain saws,

629
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,840
and eat hamburgers, for a long 
 time before I get tired of 'em.

630
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,630
Don't hurt yourself 
 on that burger boy.

631
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:08,090
He always eats too much 
 when you give him regular food.

632
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,760
You got anything I can 
 write a letter to Pap with?

633
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:11,970
I thought he was dead.

634
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:13,930
He is

635
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:16,480
but I write a letter, then burn it 
 so he can read the smoke.

636
01:06:16,850 --> 01:06:18,770
Moon, that's the dumbest thing 
 I ever heard of.

637
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,780
You don't mind do ya?

638
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,700
You can do what ever 
 you want around here?

639
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:27,910
There's writtin' stuff 
 in the kitchen drawer.

640
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:38,250
<i>Dear Pap</i>

641
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:42,800
<i>I know it's been a long time 
 since I've written anything to you</i>

642
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:46,630
<i>and sometimes, I wonder if you really 
 get these words in the smoke</i>

643
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,300
<i>seeing has how I 
 don't ever hear from you. </i>

644
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:53,260
<i>and I've made some decisions that I 
 don't know that you'd really like.</i>

645
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:58,640
<i>I've decided not to go to Alaska 
 at all if I've gotta be alone.</i>

646
01:07:00,110 --> 01:07:03,190
<i>I just don't think I can live up 
 there like you wanted me to live.</i>

647
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,480
<i>I'd be too lonely, Pap.</i>

648
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:08,320
<i>Why did we have to live up there 
 like we did Pap?</i>

649
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:10,490
<i>Why couldn't I 
 have any friends?</i>

650
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:13,870
<i>I just don't know what to do.</i>

651
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:19,830
<i>I'm not mad at you. 
 Love, Moon</i>

652
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,230
Where's Snapper?

653
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:44,070
He likes to sleep with my dad.

654
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,360
What happened to Rachel?

655
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:51,200
She only lives about 
 10 miles from here.

656
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,370
When I drive over, she usually 
 sneaks out to meet me.

657
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,830
We can go over there and see 
 her tomorrow if you want.

658
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:58,000
That'd be nice.

659
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:01,080
But first I want to 
 stop off and see Kit.

660
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,500
I told you. We gotta 
 wait till he's better.

661
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:06,670
Probably won't let anybody 
 in with him right now anyway.

662
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:09,630
You know how he hates 
 those hospitals.

663
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,930
Sure he hates dead a lot more.

664
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:16,510
Hal?

665
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:18,060
What Moon?

666
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,850
I think my Pap was wrong 
 about a lot of stuff.

667
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,690
Wanting to live out there 
 in that forest?

668
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,440
No, I like living in the forest.

669
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:30,400
I don't know where 
 else I'd be.

670
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,570
I just don't want 
 to be my myself.

671
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:36,620
Me and Pap were always 
 by ourselves.

672
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
- I'm a little tired. 
 - I'm not.

673
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:43,330
I wanna try and see Kit.

674
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:45,500
Can't it just wait 
 a couple of more days?

675
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,420
- I can't. 
 - I told you we gotta wait

676
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:50,550
He doesn't like to be alone.

677
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,340
- Please. 
 - Fine then.

678
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:58,310
Well...better not get 
 my ass in to hell though.

679
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:00,730
- Goodnight. 
 - Goodnight.

680
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:06,480
Thanks for getting me out of Pinson.

681
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,150
Goodnight.

682
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:20,450
Don't stay there too long.

683
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:23,120
People start asking questions, 
 get the hell out of there.

684
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:25,880
I ain't stayin' around if 
 the cops start pouring in here.

685
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
- I don't want you to. 
 - Good, cause I ain't.

686
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:42,520
Be careful.

687
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:04,040
- Umm...where's Kit? 
 - Who?

688
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:06,330
The boy that was out in the forest.

689
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:09,500
Oh, him. He's in the 
 intensive care unit.

690
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,590
And, how do I get in with him?

691
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,220
That's not allowed here. 
 Just wait, right there.

692
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:19,890
Wait, wait!

693
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:21,720
Kit!

694
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:25,480
Kit, it's me!

695
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,310
It's me.

696
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:30,980
I knew you'd 
 come for your little friend.

697
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:32,820
Just let me see him, 
 I just want to talk to him.

698
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:34,280
He doesn't like the hospitals.

699
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:37,910
Oh, it don't matter anyway. 
 He's still out like a light.

700
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:43,540
You seem to have 
 lost your spunk.

701
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,120
You can't do anything 
 to me that matters.

702
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,880
I don't got anywhere 
 to go anymore.

703
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:53,250
Oh, you've got 
 somewhere to go.

704
01:10:54,340 --> 01:11:00,550
We're gonna have a whole 
 day of fun, you and me.

705
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:27,160
Get out.

706
01:11:29,830 --> 01:11:30,830
This isn't Pinson.

707
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,670
No...you're going to be beggin' 
 for Pinson by the time I'm done with ya.

708
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:38,050
First, you're gonna show me 
 where you buried your daddy.

709
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:42,680
Then, I'm gonna kick that smart 
 ass attitude out of your hide.

710
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,020
What's going on here?

711
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:47,560
Police matters.

712
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,560
Requiring a dog leash?

713
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:52,360
Listen Slick, this is 
 none of your b...

714
01:11:53,270 --> 01:11:55,150
This is your fault!

715
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:57,190
Get the hell off 
 of my property.

716
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,110
Now!

717
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:55,330
What's your plan now?

718
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:58,550
I've been thinking about it

719
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:00,670
and if Sanders can't get to me, 
 he'll go after Kit.

720
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,680
Did you do everything the 
 constable said you did?

721
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:07,970
- No! 
 - I believe you.

722
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,850
What I've seen of the constable, 
 he's a bully and a bigot.

723
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:13,020
And a liar.

724
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:17,770
Well you've damaged his pride, and he 
 doesn't take very well to that.

725
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:24,530
Moon, I feel responsible for a 
 lot of what happened to you.

726
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:29,790
I spent my whole life... 
 defending our legal system

727
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:33,460
sometimes it just doesn't 
 work out very well.

728
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:37,710
You needed...something else.

729
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,210
You could've let me stay, and 
 live out there in your woods.

730
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,130
All by yourself?

731
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:49,060
Moon...I'm gonna try 
 and help you.

732
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,390
I'm gonna get this map

733
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:56,480
and you're going to show 
 me where everything happened

734
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:58,860
right from the beginning.

735
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:04,150
Alright now, 
 we are...

736
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,860
here.

737
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:08,200
Yeah , yeah. I remember 
 going up this trail.

738
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,080
- Do you remember this highway? 
 - Yeah, I passed that...

739
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,460
We're going to Tuscaloosa.

740
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:18,670
The judge there said he'd 
 be willing to hold you in his jail...

741
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,840
while I try and make a 
 a case for you.

742
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:22,590
Okay.

743
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:31,510
And you'll be safe from Sanders.

744
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,100
What if...?

745
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,780
- What about Kit? 
 - Let's worry about you first

746
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,900
Kit's safe where he is.

747
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,530
What'ya think you're doing?

748
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:27,530
That boy is supposed to 
 be in my custody.

749
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:30,070
We've already discussed that 
 over the phone Constable...

750
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:32,070
I don't care what we 
 discussed on the phone...

751
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,240
- Get your hands down. 
 - Hey, don't touch me.

752
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,200
Hey, get your hands 
 off me.

753
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:38,120
Did you talk with 
 Mr. Wellington yet?

754
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:42,130
- I'm not a news service, kid. 
 - But I've been here two days!

755
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:54,260
Hey, kid. 
 Come on.

756
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,810
Mr. Wellington sent 
 these over

757
01:15:56,970 --> 01:15:58,730
you put them on, 
 and we'll go.

758
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,410
Moon, get out, 
 come talk to us.

759
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,550
How are you felling?

760
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,090
Do you have a lawyer?

761
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:34,350
Are you scared?

762
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,940
Go in there and sit 
 with your lawyer, son.

763
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,950
- I thought you'd left me. 
 - Quiet!

764
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:54,160
You don't speak unless you're 
 given permission, you hear?

765
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:55,780
Yes sir.

766
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:58,660
Now, we've got an unusual situation here.

767
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:01,410
and because of that, 
 I've closed this hearing to the public.

768
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:03,420
And I got a headache

769
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:05,750
and those people out there 
 are driving me crazy.

770
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:10,840
Moon Blake, you have stirred up 
 quite a commotion here...

771
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:12,880
and I don't like the commotion.

772
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:15,760
and I don't like people who shoot 
 at our law enforement officers

773
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,010
and I don't like people who eat 
 other people's dogs.

774
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:19,770
Sanders is a liar!

775
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:21,890
Hey! Did I ask you a question?

776
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,060
No.

777
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,570
Okay then, let's get started. 
 Come on up here, Constable Sanders.

778
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,990
- You're not gonna lie are ya? 
 - No Your Honor.

779
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,370
Alright. Go on then, let's 
 hear your side.

780
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:46,380
Well, I sent my trackin' dog 
 after the boy

781
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,750
He caught the dog and 
 must of ate it.

782
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:53,260
When I caught up to him, 
 he shot at me.

783
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,640
Shot at you with what?

784
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,640
A pistol.

785
01:17:58,180 --> 01:17:59,720
Where'd he get it?

786
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:00,890
He stole it from me.

787
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:05,480
He stole it from you?

788
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,270
I took it. I threw 
 it in the lake

789
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,110
I never shot at you!

790
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,320
Well, the kid admits he 
 took your gun away from you.

791
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:14,320
How in the heck 
 did that happen?

792
01:18:16,490 --> 01:18:18,620
- I dropped it. 
 - You're a liar!

793
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:20,790
I snuck up on you 
 and I took it.

794
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:23,870
Hey! You want me to gag you boy? 
 Hush.

795
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:28,290
Okay. That all?

796
01:18:28,290 --> 01:18:30,000
Ain't that enough?

797
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:31,710
Get up here, Wellington.

798
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:38,390
Good morning Constable.

799
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:39,850
Morning Slick.

800
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:46,140
Contable Sanders, how many 
 times did the boy fire at you?

801
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:50,480
Oh, at least 4 or 5 times. 
 I'm lucky to be alive.

802
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:56,610
I didn't shoot at him.

803
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:06,790
Constable Sanders, is this 
 your service revolver?

804
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:13,170
Well, it looks sorta similar.

805
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,970
The serial number matches 
 the county record.

806
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:22,890
This is your gun. I had it retrieved from 
 the pond where the boy said he through it.

807
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:27,310
Notice You Honor, the gun 
 still contains six rounds.

808
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,400
This gun has not been fired.

809
01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:32,440
How do you explain 
 that Constable?

810
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:34,730
Yeah Constable. 
 How do you explain that?

811
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:37,780
Well, I...

812
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,990
Constable Sanders, how long have 
 you been a law enforcement officer?

813
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:42,910
Fifteen years.

814
01:19:42,990 --> 01:19:45,750
And never had any employment or 
 part-time work outside the profession?

815
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:47,870
No.

816
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,370
In fact, if a constable were to 
 accept money for favors

817
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:53,090
that would be considered 
 accepting a bribe, would't it?

818
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:57,590
Hey, wha wha what are you 
 trying to pull here?

819
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:01,470
So you've never done any work, 
 or favors, for the Pinson Boys Home?

820
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:04,560
Not that I recall.

821
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,600
Then why, would the Pinson 
 Boys Home have any entry

822
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,810
to you in the cash log 
 for $500

823
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:13,440
on the very same day 
 of the escape?

824
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:21,610
Me and the director 
 are gamblin' buddies.

825
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:25,950
Constable, you better hope this 
 ain't going were I think it's going.

826
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,040
Your Honor, I would like to 
 introduce some witnesses.

827
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,830
Yeah. Bring'em on in.

828
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:42,050
- Hal! 
 - Hey Moon.

829
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:43,470
Hey Rachel.

830
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:47,350
Your Honor, I would like to introduce 
 Mr. Mitchell, his son Hal,

831
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,770
Rachel Gene, and Snapper.

832
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:51,520
Constable Sander's dog.

833
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:53,480
That's a damn lie!

834
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:56,320
No, that's your dead dog.

835
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:57,730
Slick.

836
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:00,900
Sit back down Constable.

837
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:07,700
What's wrong with you?

838
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:10,500
Why would a grown man 
 act like this over a kid?

839
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,920
Not only have you lied to me

840
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,790
it seems mighty suspicious 
 that you've accepted a payoff.

841
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:19,920
He did! He got Daddy to 
 pay him to go after Moon.

842
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:22,130
I got the cash log for Mr. Wellington

843
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,390
Bennet, put this red neck 
 hick in my jail?

844
01:21:27,770 --> 01:21:30,470
And call the Livingston PD and 
 tell them he's been reassigned

845
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,690
- to the state penitentiary. 
 - You can't run a trial like this.

846
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:37,020
- I just did. 
 - Get your hands off me!

847
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:41,860
I told you he was a liar!

848
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,120
Hal Mitchell, 
 am I lookin' for you?

849
01:21:49,290 --> 01:21:50,290
Yes sir.

850
01:21:50,460 --> 01:21:55,370
I guess you realize this is your last stop 
 before Helen Wyler?

851
01:21:57,710 --> 01:21:59,550
Sir, I know.

852
01:22:01,970 --> 01:22:03,550
Kid, what am I'm gonna 
 to do with you?

853
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:04,840
Your Honor,

854
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:07,930
ironically, all the publicity 
 surrounding the case

855
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:11,270
has brought about an unexpected 
 bit of good fortune.

856
01:22:12,190 --> 01:22:15,560
Relatives have heard of the boy's 
 flight and have come forward

857
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:19,860
I spoke to the boy's 
 uncle this morning.\

858
01:22:20,490 --> 01:22:22,650
and he is eager 
 to adopt Moon.

859
01:22:23,660 --> 01:22:24,740
Uncle?

860
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:28,740
Well, where's the uncle been, while 
 this kid has been raising cane all over Alabama?

861
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:30,830
They live in Mobile Your Honor.

862
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,460
The family has been searching for 
 the boy and his father for years.

863
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,630
They are very thankful that 
 Moon has been found.

864
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:42,460
Seems like a nice man, 
 and a very nice family.

865
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:48,890
Moon! 
 Behave yourself.

866
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:52,770
It's great, Moon.

867
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:54,980
I ought to woop you good 
 for doing what you did today

868
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,520
They were gonna find me anyway.

869
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:59,110
Well Moon, 
 I am proud of my boy.

870
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:02,270
- He done the right thing. 
 - Let's go, Hal.

871
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,280
- I love you, Dad. 
 - I love you, son.

872
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,530
- Bye, Hal. 
 - See ya, Moon

873
01:23:08,570 --> 01:23:10,490
He's a damn good boy.

874
01:23:10,740 --> 01:23:14,410
Well, Moon, you call if 
 you need anything.

875
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:17,460
um...I've gotta go too, Moon. 
 My mom's waiting outside.

876
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,790
Will call me on the tellephone 
 when you get to Mobile?

877
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:22,090
- Bye Rachel. 
 - Bye.

878
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,380
Can we go see Kit now?

879
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,280
Can you help me with a patient?

880
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:52,950
A young boy about his age. 
 His name is Kit.

881
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:46,940
I was afraid you might have 
 gone back to your old ways again.

882
01:25:50,070 --> 01:25:52,110
- Hey, I need some stuff to write with. 
 - Yeah.

883
01:25:57,410 --> 01:25:59,450
- Will this do? 
 - Yeah.

884
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:04,580
Sure you don't want 
 to come inside?

885
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,540
- No, I'm okay. 
 - Okay. I understand.

886
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,380
I'll leave the light on 
 if you change your mind.

887
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:32,110
<i>I started in telling Kit all the 
 things I had planned for us.</i>

888
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,320
<i>All those things we never 
 got the chance to do together.</i>

889
01:26:36,490 --> 01:26:39,450
<i>Fish we never caught, traps 
 I never showed him how to make</i>

890
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:40,870
<i>the places we never saw.</i>

891
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:44,910
<i>And all the things we missed 
 out on doing together.</i>

892
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:47,790
<i>I guessed Kit would 
 want to know these things.</i>

893
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,050
<i>So I told him how 
 much I missed him.</i>

894
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:53,210
<i>and how I'd always 
 think of him.</i>

895
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:55,340
<i>as my best friend.</i>

896
01:27:07,230 --> 01:27:09,110
I'm sorry, Moon.

897
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:12,190
I'm so sorry.

898
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:15,860
Kit's all alone up there now.

899
01:27:16,450 --> 01:27:18,110
I know.

900
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:21,370
And Moon... 
 it's not your fault.

901
01:27:21,790 --> 01:27:23,540
The doctors told me.

902
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,790
Your friend was very sick.

903
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,960
He wasn't ever 
 going to get well.

904
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:34,460
The nurses told me, all 
 Kit could talk about

905
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:36,670
was his adventures 
 out there in the woods

906
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,680
the weeks he spent with you.

907
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:43,970
He had the best time in his 
 whole life, out there with you.

908
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:57,360
I miss him though.

909
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:00,990
- I miss him so much. 
 - I know.

910
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:05,750
And it's okay 
 that you do.

911
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,280
Hey Moon. 
 I'm your uncle Mike.

912
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:43,490
Hey. 
 I don't remember you.

913
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:47,370
Well, we've been 
 lookin' for you.

914
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:49,500
And it's taken a long time, 
 and I'm sorry about that.

915
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:55,000
- You ain't mad about this? 
 - No, I'm not mad.

916
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,920
You got a whole bunch 
 of family down in Mobile

917
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:01,050
all excited to see you.

918
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:10,940
Thank you for all you've 
 done, Mr. Wellington.

919
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,810
Pap was wrong about you.

920
01:29:15,070 --> 01:29:16,230
You are a good person.

921
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:19,110
Well there are a lot of 
 good people out there Moon.

922
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,650
I'm sure you'll find 
 that out for yourself.

923
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:26,450
- You ready? 
 - Yeah.

924
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,010
Bye, Mr. Wellington. 
 Come and visit us.

925
01:29:40,970 --> 01:29:43,010
Yeah, I get down 
 that way.

926
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:13,330
Well I guess you're 
 my new Pap, right?

927
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:17,590
I could never replace your Pap...

928
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:21,760
but... I would like for you to 
 think of me that way, yeah.

929
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,050
So you came and looked for us?

930
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:28,930
Yeah, we went lookin' for ya.

931
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:34,270
Your dad just... 
 he kinda disappeared.

932
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:36,850
He didn't leave a trace 
 of where he was going.

933
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,400
Why did I we live 
 out there like that?

934
01:30:41,490 --> 01:30:42,610
Why couldn't I 
 have any friends?

935
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:46,530
Well...

936
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:50,740
maybe that was what 
 he was running from, huh?

937
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:55,920
Moon, your dad... 
 just kinda did his own thing

938
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:59,380
and went his own way 
 and he didn't trust most people.

939
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:03,260
I think when your mom died, 
 he took it pretty hard.

940
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:09,470
- I lost a good friend too. 
 - Yeah, I heard about that.

941
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,640
I'm Sorry.

942
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:20,560
You know, Moon? 
 The important thing...

943
01:31:22,110 --> 01:31:25,150
is that, you don't have to 
 feel like he did.

944
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:28,530
Most people don't.

945
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:10,280
Moon, this is your Aunt Sarah.

946
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,750
- And this is Alice. 
 - Hi.

947
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:26,800
And this is David.

948
01:32:26,970 --> 01:32:28,800
- Hey. 
 - Hi.

949
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:33,050
Alice, tell him about 
 your mean hot chocolate.

950
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:36,810
Come on.

951
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:03,770
- Hey buddy, you okay? 
 - Yeah.

952
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:12,070
I was just going to write 
 a smoke letter to Kit and Pap

953
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:16,320
telling them where I was, and 
 how nice things are here.

954
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:23,540
But...I don't believe that smoke 
 letters really work anymore.

955
01:34:26,250 --> 01:34:29,710
I bet they know. 
 Don't you think?

956
01:34:31,050 --> 01:34:32,840
I bet they know.

957
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:37,140
You know Moon. We don't expect you 
 to just slide into everything here.

958
01:34:38,430 --> 01:34:40,260
It's a lot to get used to.

959
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:43,020
especially coming from a background 
 as different as yours.

960
01:34:45,650 --> 01:34:50,110
We'll just take it slow. I just know 
 everything's gonna be fine.

961
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,900
- Right? 
 - OK.

962
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:08,250
- Can I make hot chocolate? 
 - You bet you can. It's cold out here.
