00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:30,262
After what them dusters done to the land,
the tenant system don't work no more.

156
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,931
They don't even break even,
much less show profit.

157
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:36,518
One man and a tractor
can handle 12 or 14 of these places.

158
00:13:36,686 --> 00:13:38,937
You just pay him a wage
and take all the crop.

159
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:44,276
Yeah, but we couldn't do on any less
than what our share is now.

160
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:48,947
The children ain't getting enough to eat
as it is. And they're so ragged...

161
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:52,618
...we'd be ashamed if everybody else's
children wasn't the same way.

162
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:56,455
I can't help that. I got my orders.
They told me to tell you to get off.

163
00:13:56,623 --> 00:13:59,708
- That's what I'm telling you.
- You mean get off my own land?

164
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:03,212
- Don't go to blaming me. It ain't
my fault. - Whose fault is it?

165
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,632
You know who owns the land.
Shawnee Land and Cattle Company.

166
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,386
- Who's Shawnee Land and Cattle Company?
- It ain't nobody. It's a company.

167
00:14:10,553 --> 00:14:14,890
They got a president, ain't they? They got
somebody who knows what a shotgun's for!

168
00:14:15,058 --> 00:14:18,477
Oh, son, it ain't his fault
because the bank tells him what to do.

169
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:22,815
- All right. Where's the bank?
- Tulsa. What's the use of picking on him?

170
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:27,569
He ain't nothing but the manager. He's half
crazy trying to keep up with his orders.

171
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:31,073
- Then who do we shoot?
- Brother, I don't know.

172
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:34,827
If I did, I'd tell you.
I just don't know who's to blame.

173
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:36,662
I'm right here to tell you, mister:

174
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,289
There ain't nobody
gonna push me off my land!

175
00:14:39,457 --> 00:14:42,668
My grandpa took up this land
70 years ago!

176
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:46,046
My pa was born here.
We was all born on it!

177
00:14:46,214 --> 00:14:49,633
And some of us was killed on it!

178
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,604
And some of us died on it.

179
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:05,107
That's what makes it our'n.

180
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:07,526
Being born on it...

181
00:15:07,694 --> 00:15:11,155
...and working on it...

182
00:15:11,448 --> 00:15:14,616
...and dying. Dying on it!

183
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:19,746
And not no piece of paper
with writing on it.

184
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:33,343
Well, what happened?

185
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:40,559
They come.
They come and pushed me off.

186
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:42,853
- They come with the cats.
- The what?

187
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:46,398
The cats, the caterpillar tractors.

188
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:10,088
And for every one of them...

189
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:14,760
...there was 10, 15 families
thrown right out of their homes.

190
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:19,765
A hundred folks.
And no place to live but on the road.

191
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:24,353
The Rances, the Peterses,
the Perrys, the Joadses.

192
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:27,231
One right after the other,
they got thrown out.

193
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:32,486
Half the folks you and me know
thrown right out into the road.

194
00:16:34,364 --> 00:16:38,575
The one that got me come,
oh, about a month ago.

195
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,786
MULEY:
Go on back!

196
00:16:40,954 --> 00:16:45,415
Go on back!
I'm warning you, go on back!

197
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:57,970
You come any closer and I'm gonna
blow you right out of that cat!

198
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:01,306
I told you!

199
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,560
Why, you're Joe Davis' boy.

200
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:07,104
I don't like for nobody
to draw a bead on me.

201
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:10,315
Then what are you doing this for?
Against your own people.

202
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:13,235
Three dollars a day,
that's what I'm doing it for.

203
00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:18,615
I got two little kids at home. My wife,
my wife's mother. Them folks gotta eat.

204
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:20,801
First and only, I think about my folks.

205
00:17:20,802 --> 00:17:23,161
What happens to others
is their own lookout.

206
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:26,206
Yeah, but you don't understand, son.
This is my land!

207
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,126
Used to be your land.
It's the company's now.

208
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:34,339
Have it your own way, son. But just as sure
as you touch my house with that cat...

209
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:37,467
...I'm gonna blow you
plumb to kingdom come!

210
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:42,014
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First
place, they'd hang you and you know it.

211
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:45,601
It wouldn't be two days before
they'd send a guy to take my place.

212
00:17:45,768 --> 00:17:47,519
Now go on! Get out of the way!

213
00:18:27,852 --> 00:18:31,063
What was the use? He was right.

214
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,358
And there wasn't a thing in the world
I could do about it.

215
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:41,239
It's just, it don't seem possible
just getting throwed off like that.

216
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:44,076
The rest of my family set out
for the West.

217
00:18:44,243 --> 00:18:49,498
There wasn't nothing to eat, but I couldn't
leave. Something just wouldn't let me.

218
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:57,214
So now I just wander around
and sleep wherever I am.

219
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:02,260
I used to tell myself
that I was looking out for things...

220
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:07,265
...so that when the folks come back,
everything would be all right.

221
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:10,435
But I knowed it wasn't true.

222
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,522
There ain't nothing to look out for...

223
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,067
...and there ain't nobody
ever coming back.

224
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:19,695
They're gone!

225
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:22,406
And me...

226
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:26,910
...I'm just an old graveyard ghost.

227
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:30,997
That's all in the world I am.

228
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:36,420
Do you think I'm touched?

229
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:42,509
No.

230
00:19:42,885 --> 00:19:45,470
You're lonely, but...

231
00:19:45,638 --> 00:19:47,139
...you ain't touched.

232
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:53,437
Well, it don't matter. If I'm touched,
I'm touched and that's all there is to it.

233
00:19:53,604 --> 00:19:58,150
The thing I don't understand
is my folks taking it. Like Ma.

234
00:19:58,317 --> 00:20:01,820
I seen her nearly beat a peddler
to death with a live chicken.

235
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:04,156
She aimed to go with an ax
in the other hand...

236
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:06,575
...got mixed up, forgot which was which.

237
00:20:06,743 --> 00:20:10,954
When she got through with that peddler,
all she had left was two chicken legs.

238
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:13,582
Just a...

239
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,170
Just a plain old graveyard ghost.

240
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:20,505
That's all.

241
00:20:34,812 --> 00:20:37,189
She's settling.

242
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:43,570
What do you figure on doing?

243
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:45,947
It's hard to say.

244
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:50,160
Stay here till morning,
go to Uncle John's, I reckon.

245
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:52,829
After that, I don't know.

246
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:55,999
Listen.

247
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:05,550
That's them. Them lights.

248
00:21:07,053 --> 00:21:09,513
Come on. Come on. We gotta hide out.

249
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,974
Hide out for what?
We ain't doing nothing.

250
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:18,355
You're trespassing. This ain't your land no
more. That's the superintendent with a gun.

251
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:22,108
- Come on!
- Come on, Tom. You're on parole.

252
00:21:45,007 --> 00:21:46,925
Muley!

253
00:22:01,107 --> 00:22:04,234
All you gotta do is hide and watch.

254
00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:08,113
- Won't they come out here?
- Ha, ha. I don't think so.

255
00:22:08,281 --> 00:22:10,490
- One came out once and I clipped him...
- Shh!

256
00:22:10,658 --> 00:22:13,118
...from behind with a fence stake.

257
00:22:13,286 --> 00:22:15,871
They ain't bothered since.

258
00:22:20,418 --> 00:22:22,502
He ain't here.

259
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:36,850
Anybody ever told me
I'd be hiding out at my own place...

260
00:22:42,064 --> 00:22:44,065
[DOG BARKING]

261
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:55,243
Lord, make us grateful
for what we are about to receive...

262
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:58,496
...for his sake. Amen.

263
00:22:58,664 --> 00:23:01,082
I seen you. You ate during grace.

264
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,628
Just one little dab.
Just one teeny little old dab, that's all.

265
00:23:05,338 --> 00:23:09,758
- Ain't he messy though. - I seen
him. Gobbling away like an old pig.

266
00:23:09,926 --> 00:23:12,636
Why don't you keep your eyes shut
during grace, you old...?

267
00:23:12,803 --> 00:23:15,013
What's it say again, Uncle John?

268
00:23:16,182 --> 00:23:21,019
It says, "Plenty of work in California.
Eight hundred pickers wanted."

269
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:29,152
Wait till I get to California.

270
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,822
I'm gonna reach up and pick me
an orange whenever I want it.

271
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:37,702
Or some grapes. Now, there's something
I ain't never had enough of.

272
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,081
I'm gonna get me a whole
big bunch of grapes off a bush...

273
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:43,792
...and I'm gonna squash them
all over my face...

274
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,795
...and let the juice
drain down off of my chin.

275
00:23:46,963 --> 00:23:49,339
Praise the Lord for victory!

276
00:23:49,507 --> 00:23:52,717
Maybe I'll get me
a whole washtub full of grapes...

277
00:23:52,885 --> 00:23:59,057
...and just sit in them and scrounge
around in them until they're all gone.

278
00:24:00,142 --> 00:24:02,811
I sure would like that.

279
00:24:02,979 --> 00:24:08,233
Yes, sir, I sure would like that. Heh.

280
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:29,587
Oh, thank God. Thank God.

281
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,924
Tommy.

282
00:24:37,722 --> 00:24:39,723
Ma.

283
00:24:45,229 --> 00:24:48,064
You didn't bust out, did you?
You ain't gotta hide?

284
00:24:48,232 --> 00:24:51,776
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.

285
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:56,781
I was so scared
we was going away without you...

286
00:24:56,949 --> 00:25:00,285
...and we'd never see each other again.

287
00:25:00,494 --> 00:25:03,079
I'd have found you, Ma.

288
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:09,461
Muley told me what happened.

289
00:25:09,628 --> 00:25:11,629
We going to California true?

290
00:25:11,797 --> 00:25:14,591
Oh, we've gotta go, Tommy,
but it's gonna be all right.

291
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:20,138
I seen the handbills about how much
work there is, and high wages too.

292
00:25:20,848 --> 00:25:25,977
There's something I gotta find out first,
Tommy. Did they hurt you, son?

293
00:25:26,145 --> 00:25:28,271
Did they hurt you
and make you mean mad?

294
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,606
Mad, Ma?

295
00:25:29,774 --> 00:25:33,610
- Sometimes they do.
- No, Ma. I was at first, but not no more.

296
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:35,570
Sometimes they do something to you.

297
00:25:36,405 --> 00:25:39,491
They hurt you and you get mad
and then you get mean.

298
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:42,744
And they hurt you again
and you get meaner and meaner...

299
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:48,124
...till you ain't no boy nor man anymore,
just a walking chunk of mean mad.

300
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:52,337
- Did they hurt you that way, son?
- No, Ma. Don't worry about that.

301
00:25:52,505 --> 00:25:54,089
Well, I...

302
00:25:54,256 --> 00:25:56,508

1345
02:01:24,147 --> 02:01:26,899
I can't. I don't know enough.

1346
02:01:27,651 --> 02:01:29,693
How am I gonna
know about you, Tommy?

1347
02:01:30,570 --> 02:01:33,072
Why, they could kill you
and I'd never know.

1348
02:01:33,240 --> 02:01:36,075
They could hurt you.
How am I gonna know?

1349
02:01:38,328 --> 02:01:43,123
Well, maybe it's like Casy says.

1350
02:01:43,333 --> 02:01:46,836
Fella ain't got a soul of his own,
just...

1351
02:01:47,003 --> 02:01:49,004
...a little piece of a big soul.

1352
02:01:49,172 --> 02:01:52,591
The one big soul
that belongs to everybody.

1353
02:01:53,552 --> 02:01:55,427
Then...

1354
02:01:55,595 --> 02:01:59,306
- Then what, Tom?
- Then it don't matter.

1355
02:01:59,558 --> 02:02:02,560
I'll be all around in the dark.

1356
02:02:02,727 --> 02:02:04,520
I'll be everywhere...

1357
02:02:04,688 --> 02:02:07,106
...wherever you can look.

1358
02:02:07,941 --> 02:02:13,904
Wherever there's a fight
so hungry people can eat, I'll be there.

1359
02:02:14,197 --> 02:02:19,535
Wherever there's a cop beating up a guy,
I'll be there.

1360
02:02:20,328 --> 02:02:22,830
I'll be in the way guys yell
when they're mad.

1361
02:02:24,541 --> 02:02:30,296
I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're
hungry and they know supper's ready.

1362
02:02:31,172 --> 02:02:35,926
And when the people
are eating the stuff they raise...

1363
02:02:36,344 --> 02:02:39,346
...and living in the houses they build...

1364
02:02:39,848 --> 02:02:42,141
...I'll be there too.

1365
02:02:45,812 --> 02:02:48,230
I don't understand it, Tom.

1366
02:02:49,441 --> 02:02:52,276
Me neither, Ma, but...

1367
02:02:52,736 --> 02:02:55,195
...it's just something
I've been thinking about.

1368
02:02:56,990 --> 02:02:58,866
Give me your hand, Ma.

1369
02:03:01,453 --> 02:03:02,995
Goodbye.

1370
02:03:03,163 --> 02:03:05,289
Goodbye, Tommy.

1371
02:03:05,457 --> 02:03:08,667
Later, when this is blowed over...

1372
02:03:08,835 --> 02:03:10,920
...you'll come back?

1373
02:03:11,087 --> 02:03:13,172
Sure, Ma.

1374
02:03:14,174 --> 02:03:18,344
Tom, we ain't the kissing kind, but...

1375
02:03:25,477 --> 02:03:27,519
Goodbye, Ma.

1376
02:03:28,146 --> 02:03:30,356
Goodbye, Tommy.

1377
02:03:38,406 --> 02:03:40,491
Tommy.

1378
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:21,073
MAN:
Goodbye.

1379
02:04:25,578 --> 02:04:27,913
PA:
Turn that up, Al, and get her rolled up.

1380
02:04:28,081 --> 02:04:30,040
- How you fixed, John?
JOHN: Getting along.

1381
02:04:30,208 --> 02:04:31,917
PA:
Here.

1382
02:04:33,086 --> 02:04:35,045
Winfield, get on top, out of the way.

1383
02:04:35,213 --> 02:04:37,423
I don't see what you folks
are hurrying so for.

1384
02:04:37,590 --> 02:04:39,633
They tell me there's 20 days' work
up there.

1385
02:04:40,093 --> 02:04:42,594
Yes, sir, and we aim to get in
all 20 of them.

1386
02:04:42,762 --> 02:04:46,098
AL: All ready, Ma?
- Yes. How you feeling, Rosasharn?

1387
02:04:46,266 --> 02:04:49,727
All aboard, everybody.
All aboard for Fresno.

1388
02:04:49,894 --> 02:04:52,396
MAN:
Wait a minute. I'll give you a hand.

1389
02:04:52,564 --> 02:04:55,691
- Careful of her, now.
MAN: Easy, child.

1390
02:05:00,947 --> 02:05:03,032
PA:
She'll be all right.

1391
02:05:06,619 --> 02:05:10,080
- Watch her, John.
JOHN: I'll take care of her.

1392
02:05:11,458 --> 02:05:14,793
PA: How are you fixed, Al?
AL: All right, Pa.

1393
02:05:18,548 --> 02:05:20,466
Now, Ma...

1394
02:05:26,306 --> 02:05:27,806
WOMAN:
Goodbye.

1395
02:05:28,224 --> 02:05:30,601
MAN: Bye.
WOMAN: Goodbye.

1396
02:05:33,021 --> 02:05:36,065
RUTHIE: Bye-bye.
WINFIELD: Goodbye.

1397
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:39,651
- Thanks a lot. Goodbye.
RUTHIE: Goodbye.

1398
02:05:39,819 --> 02:05:42,529
JOHN:
Thanks, Mr. Conway.

1399
02:05:44,824 --> 02:05:46,241
RUTHIE & WINFIELD: Bye.
- Be careful.

1400
02:05:46,409 --> 02:05:47,910
RUTHIE:
Goodbye.

1401
02:06:06,554 --> 02:06:09,431
Twenty days' work. Oh, boy!

1402
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:12,018
I'll be glad to get my
hands on some cotton.

1403
02:06:12,019 --> 02:06:14,436
That's the kind of
picking I understand.

1404
02:06:14,604 --> 02:06:19,274
Maybe. Maybe 20 days' work
and maybe no days' work.

1405
02:06:19,442 --> 02:06:23,195
- We ain't got it till we get it.
- What's the matter, Ma? Getting scared?

1406
02:06:23,613 --> 02:06:25,322
Scared. Ha!

1407
02:06:25,490 --> 02:06:28,200
I ain't never gonna be scared no more.

1408
02:06:28,368 --> 02:06:34,164
I was though. For a while, it looked
as though we was beat. Good and beat.

1409
02:06:34,332 --> 02:06:37,584
Looked like we didn't have nobody
in the whole wide world but enemies.

1410
02:06:37,752 --> 02:06:40,629
Like nobody was friendly no more.

1411
02:06:40,797 --> 02:06:44,258
Made me feel kind of bad and scared too.

1412
02:06:44,425 --> 02:06:47,636
Like we was lost and nobody cared.

1413
02:06:49,055 --> 02:06:52,057
You're the one that keeps us going, Ma.

1414
02:06:52,225 --> 02:06:55,144
I ain't no good no more and I know it.

1415
02:06:55,311 --> 02:07:00,149
Seems like I spend all my time these days
thinking how it used to be.

1416
02:07:00,316 --> 02:07:02,526
Thinking of home.

1417
02:07:03,153 --> 02:07:05,404
I ain't never gonna see it no more.

1418
02:07:05,572 --> 02:07:10,242
Well, Pa, a woman can change
better than a man.

1419
02:07:10,410 --> 02:07:14,705
A man lives sort of, well, in jerks.

1420
02:07:14,873 --> 02:07:17,457
Baby's born or somebody dies,
and that's a jerk.

1421
02:07:17,625 --> 02:07:21,461
He gets a farm or loses it,
and that's a jerk.

1422
02:07:21,629 --> 02:07:25,174
With a woman, it's all in one flow
like a stream.

1423
02:07:25,341 --> 02:07:31,346
Little eddies and waterfalls,
but the river, it goes right on.

1424
02:07:31,514 --> 02:07:34,600
A woman looks at it that way.

1425
02:07:36,936 --> 02:07:40,105
Maybe, but we're sure taking a beating.

1426
02:07:40,273 --> 02:07:41,773
I know. Heh.

1427
02:07:41,941 --> 02:07:44,234
That's what makes us tough.

1428
02:07:44,402 --> 02:07:46,862
Rich fellas come up and they die...

1429
02:07:47,030 --> 02:07:49,489
...and their kids ain't no good,
and they die out.

1430
02:07:49,657 --> 02:07:53,577
But we keep coming.
We're the people that live.

1431
02:07:53,745 --> 02:07:56,955
They can't wipe us out.
They can't lick us.

1432
02:07:57,123 --> 02:08:02,085
We'll go on forever, Pa,
because we're the people.

1433
02:09:04,023 --> 02:09:05,023
